Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing if you please
Though you tried to bring me to my knees, Too bad too bad about it

Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah

My feet are hurtin mighty bad
Now Ive been walkin for three days
And two lonely nights you know that Im mighty bad, But I got a girl waitin for me
Thats gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, shes got the kind
Of lovin and kissin make a boy go stone wild, I got to keep on walkin
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you, yall Im so tired
But I just cant lose my stride, I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin my name
Its as if, as though Im standin at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing, Now Ill be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine, I got to keep on walkin
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you, yall Im so tired
But I just cant lose my stride, Yeah, I got to walk on let me tell you
Yall hope my feet dont fail me now
I got five more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven, six, oh six, I got five more miles to go now
Over the hills just around the bend
Although my feet are tired, I cant lose my stride
I got to get my baby back again, I got to keep on walkin
I got to walk on
Let me tell yall Im so tired now
But I just cant lose my stride, Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you now Im so tired

"A Place With No Name Lyrics","2010","Michael-Jackson","A-Place-With-No-Name-Lyrics","As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat, So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist, I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there, Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
No Name, As she took me right through the fog
I see a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
No one's in fear, She said this is the place where no people have pain
And in love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend, Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah, She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done
This place really looks like a lotta fun, I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
and not a world could I wanna leave, So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world, Ooh-ooh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
No name, Take me to a place without no name
No Name
Take me to a place without no name"

I am the moonlight, you are the spring,
our life's a sacred thing,
You know I always will love you, I am forever., I am the one who came when you fell down,
I was the only one around (the only one),
When things would hurt you,
I am forever., Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
When living seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you,
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever, I am your friend,
Through thick and thin,
We need each other,
We'll never part,
Our love is from the heart,
We never say ""I don't need you"",, We are forever.
I am the one who said that you are free,
When living seems so hard to be (the only one),
And nothing would cheer you,
I am forever,
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the walls came tumbling down,
When things would hurt you,
I am forever, I am forever,, We are forever, we are forever.
You are the sun that lights up the sky,
When things are shady,
Let come what may we do get by,
I was the only one around (the only one),
When things would hurt you,
We are forever (I am forever),
We are forever (I am forever),
We are forever (gotta do and do more),
We are forever (gotta do and do more, have to be strong),
We are forever (gotta do and do more),
we are forever, (uh- hum, all right),
I am forever,
I am forever,
I am forever (uh- hum, all right),
we are forever,
we are forever (hee),
I am forever,
I am forever."

"Billie Jean Lyrics","1995","Michael-Jackson","Billie-Jean-Lyrics","She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round, She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
Of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round, People always told me ""be careful of what you do""
""And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
And mother always told me ""be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"", Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son, For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice, She told ""my baby, that's a threat""
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying
Eyes were like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby, People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room, Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

"Black Or White Lyrics","1995","Michael-Jackson","Black-Or-White-Lyrics","I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none, And I told about equality
An it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil, I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business, Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody, Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations, Causing grief in human relations, It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces, Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color, Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white"

Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There's imagination workin, never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you've never known?, Break of dawn, break of dawn
There's no sun up in the sky
Break of dawn, break of dawn

It's the day, a brand new day, let's both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, makin' love 'til it's dark, can you move, can you soothe
'Til the break of dawn and you know it's true, oh

Keep me wonderin' why
When all I can do is sigh, I just wanna touch you, I just wanna touch and kiss

Here comes the rain and heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling the days
I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more, Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me, Dreams of golden glare taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need, If you can't get enough
Call on me
...
I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna to kill me not to be with you
But I want you to be happy, If heartache's what you want then I want it too
So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewheree, Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me
Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, Call on me
Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there

Lost my heart

Who ran away., Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear her crying here
And I can hear her calling me.

"Childhood Lyrics","1995","Michael-Jackson","Childhood-Lyrics","Você já tentou me amarrar
Mas o nosso amor era fogueira
Eu queria só brincar de amar
Você não queria brincadeira, Que vontade louca
Já virou um vicio
Beijar sua boca, mas sem compromisso
Eu to te querendo
Só um pouco mais
Pra ver se esse amor é o que me satisfaz, Por que você não para pra pensar
Não vê que eu to querendo seu amor
Mas não vou entrar nessa de sonhar
Pra não permanecer ao seu dispor
Melhor deixarmos tudo como está
O nosso amor foi só uma tara e mais nada
Melhor é deixar pra lá."

Childhood
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart...
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities...
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me..., People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things...
It's been my fate to compensate,
for the ChildhoodI've never known..., Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates and adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne..., Before you judge me, try hard to love me,

And will the sun ever shine
In the blind mans eyes when he cries, You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight, If people laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is taking a life (Hold on)
Respect to believe in your dreams
So tell me where were you
When your children cried last night, Faces filled with madness
Miracles unheard of (Hold on)
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do is to reach for the truth, the truth, You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight, And when that flag glows there'll be no more wars
And when all cause I will answer all your prayers (Prayers)
Show the world..., You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
You can change the world
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight
Change the world"

"Dangerous Lyrics","1991","Michael-Jackson","Dangerous-Lyrics","The Way She Came Into The Place
I Knew Right Then And There, There Was Something Different
About This Girl
The Way She Moved, Her Hair, Her Face, Her Lines
Divinity In Motion
As She Stalked The Room, I Could Feel The Aura
Of Her Presence
Every Head Turned
Feeling Passion And Lust, The Girl Was Persuasive
The Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous
I Never Knew But I Was
Walking The Line
Come Go With Me
I Said I Have No Time, And Don't You Pretend We Didn't
Talk On The Phone
My Baby Cried
She Left Me Standing Alone
She's So Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous, Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey
But You're No Damn Good For Me
She Came At Me In Sections
With The Eyes Of Desire
I Fell Trapped Into Her, Web Of Sin
A Touch, A Kiss, A Whisper Of Love
I Was At The Point
Of No Return
Deep In The Darkness Of, Passion's Insanity
I Felt Taken By Lust's
Strange Inhumanity
This Girl Was Persuasive
This Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous
I Never Knew, But I Was Living In Vain
She Called My House
She Said You Know My Name
And Don't You Pretend
You Never Did Me Before

I Can not Sleep Alone Tonight
My Baby Left Me Here Tonight
I Cannot Cope 'Til It's All Right
You And Your Manipulation, You Hurt My Baby
And Then It Happened
She Touched Me
For The Lips Of
A Strange Woman
Drop As A Honeycomb, And Her Mouth Was
Smoother Than Oil
But Her Inner Spirit And Words
Were As Sharp As
A Two-Edged Sword
But I Loved It, 'Cause It's Dangerous

Father runs to the table, he says ""What's going on?""
Mother cries desperately, ""Our little baby's gone!"", Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street

Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her

Just imagine how scared they are, Save me(from this living hell)
Save me(cause I don't wanna know), Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
""I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair""
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far

He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old!, Do you know where your children are?

"Eaten Alive Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","Eaten-Alive-Lyrics","Animal stalking you at night
I'm a sucker for someone
And I got the prey in sight
Lying on a bed of leaves
In the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe, Capture me, my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you, my skin is shed
Ecstasy ain't what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the world, And you say that's impossible
That's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be, I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive, eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be eaten alive, Now I got you on the run
The quicker my senses
And the chance is, I'm the faster one
I know the universal law
Primeval times with a little stimulation
It'll come once more, And you say that's impossible
It's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be, I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive, eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be eaten alive, I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive, Tie me to a tree, crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave, anything you say
I don't ever wanna be eaten alive, I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive

You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt

"Elisabeth I Love You Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","Elisabeth-I-Love-You-Lyrics","Welcome to Hollywood
That's what they told you
A child star in Hollywood
That's what they sold you
Grace with beauty, charm and talent
You would do what you were told
But they robbed you of childhood
Took your youth and sold it for gold, Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star to me, Lovely Elizabeth
You have surpassed them all
My friend Elizabeth
Learned to outlast them all
Many started back when you did
Lost their way and now they're gone
But look at you, a true survivor
Full of life and carrying on, Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star..., This is your life
You seem to have it all
You reached your peak
They wanted you to fall
It's very sad, this world can be so bad
But though all the heartaches
When they put you down
You know you were the victor
And you earned the crown
It's like walking through the fire
Determined to win
You were beating life's battles
Again and again, Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true, Remember the time I was alone
You stood by my side and said:
""Let's be strong""
You did all these tings
That only a true friend can do, Elizabeth, I love you
The world knows your work now
Of all the things on earth now
I pray one day I'll be just like... you."

That's the new word for today
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
It's very easy to say
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart, Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still
Watch raindbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers, Euphoria
Full euphoria
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart, How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthly and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues
Euphoria never to feel frustration
How great to give love without invitation
Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other"

And everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life, I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again, We fought in a battle, nobody won
NOW WE FACE A MOUNTAIN TO BE OVERCOME
You can't run away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on, I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again, You'll try everything
You never thought WOULD WORK before
When you live, when you love, and you give them your all
You can always give up some more
BABY nothing means anything
Unless you're here TO SHARE with me, I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep
Cause you're always there in my dreams
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again, Like we did when we first met

We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye, bye, don't turn around

And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down?
Or someone that you don't forget, no?, I'll never forget you
And maybe next year, When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye, bye, don't turn around

And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything, And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder, With a tender touch, you know so well
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well
And maybe the walls will tumble
And sun may refuse to shine, But when I say 'I love you'
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'll go anywhere, just as long as you are there, And maybe the walls will tumble
And sun refuse to shine
When I say 'I love you'

Where souls embrace
So silently

And maybe the walls will crumble
And sun refuse to shine, But when I say 'I need you'

I need her sharing her world beside me, So I've got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she is my girl
When she says, ""Hello world!""
I need her sharing the world beside me, That's why I've got to be there
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows

Lost as a little lamb was I, till you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while, Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now), Where have I been, what lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until, Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently, Let Sadness see what Happy does

And lay it on the Wizard, He'll fix you a drink that's

There's no hurt or sorrow, There are ways to get there

And the entire human race

There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living, Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world, Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me, And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow, We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords
Into plowshares, We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place, Heal the world
Make it a better place

She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
only for me, then spoke with her body
her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no, That girl I can't take her

that girl I can't take her
should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her

that girl I can't take her
should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker, She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now she's thinking that I will never know
ans she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same, That girl I can't take her

But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you, and start being without you
but I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you, and stop talkin' aboout you
and what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away, Rap
You Playing Huh, I Thought It Was Love With This Game Huh
When Your Dealing With The Emotions Of Pain Huh

The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no, Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait, Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh, Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait, Just leave us alone, leave us alone
Please leave us alone"

And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me, Take me by the hand
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me

If we could make believe
If everyone would care a little more
There'd be harmoney, The city is covered in snow tonight
The children fast asleep
I'm waiting for him, but he's nowhere in sight
And I wonder if he can hear me, Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
Bring my baby home tonight, Why does it feel like it's colder than winter
Even by the fireside
My baby said he'd be home for Christmas
And now it's almost midnight
The Christmas lights up and down the street
Are such a sight to see
But all the presents by the tree
They don't mean a thing till he's with me, Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
If you hear me won't you hurry
Bring my baby tonight, I know your sleigh is full inside
But won't you stop and give my baby a ride
I'll be waiting by candle light this Christmas
The Christmas lights up and down the street
Are such a sight to see
But all the presents by the tree
They don't mean a thing
Santa please hear me, Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
If you hear me won't you hurry
Bring my baby tonight, The Christmas lights up and down the street
The presents by the tree
I hear a knock, oh can it be?
My wish is staring back at me, Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I guess you heard me tonight
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I'm underneath the mistletoe
With my baby tonight, Sleigh ride...
It's Christmas time..., Hey Santa, can you bring me something good
(Something good, something good)?
Hey Santa, can you bring me something sweet
(Something sweet, something, something sweet)?
Like chocolate kisses or candy canes.
Gumdrops or butterscotch, fruity flavor, chewy rings., Hey Santa, can you bring me something nice
(Something nice, something nice)?
Hey Santa, can you bring me something new
(Something new, something, something new)?
Like a diamond bracelet or a diamond ring.
How about a shiny new, baby blue, convertible?
Hey Santa, can you bring me everything?, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Hey Santa, can I sing this song to you
(Sing to you, sing to you)?
Hey Santa, can you make my wish come true
(Make it true, make it, make it true)?
Can you fill my stocking with lots of treats?
Boxes with red and green, underneath the Christmas tree?
Hey Santa, can you bring me everything?"

He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate

Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing..., Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty, Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history, How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die

Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy

Every child should sing together in harmony, All nations sing

Slaughtered in vain across the land

Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh..., Every day create your history

Big spenders holding their share
A heart of gold, but no one cares. (No one seems to care)

And there's some old suckers trying to get down
The evening spins around and round (Spins around and round)

And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough, Refrain

"Invincible Lyrics","2001","Michael-Jackson","Invincible-Lyrics","If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you
Just won't approve of the things that I do When all I do is for you but
Still you say it ain't cool
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do Giving you
Everything, fulfilling your fantasy Then maybe you'll change your mind and
Finally give in in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed
To do for you my baby
Yo, mami, stop the fronting, I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, ya'll have jetlag and still be fine
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible"
"Is It Scary? Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","Is-It-Scary-Lyrics","There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming up the stairs, There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere, I'm gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see, It's you who's haunting me
Because you're wanting me
To be the stranger
In the night, Am I amusing you
But just confusing me?
Am I the beast
You visualized?
And if you wanna see
Eccentric oddities
I'll be grotesque
Before your eye
Let them all materialize, Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
Is it scary for you big baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you big baby, There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is pokin', I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see, So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before
Your very eyes, A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing
In the night, But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside
A lonely heart
So let the performance start, Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
Am I scary for you big baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
So tell me
Is it scary for you baby
Tell me
So tell me
Is that realism for you big baby
Am I scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for ya, Masquerade the heart
Is the height of hurting souls
Just not what you see of me
Can hardly reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you, Is that scary for you big baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
So tell me
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you baby
Is it scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy, Wanna talk about
I wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about
Wanna talk about, Am I scary for you baby
Is that scary for you
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you baby, oh"
"Islam In My Veins Lyrics","2009","Michael-Jackson","Islam-In-My-Veins-Lyrics","Miles away, oceans apart
Never in my sight, but always in my heart, The love is always there, it will never die
Only growing stronger, a tear rolls down my eye, I'm thinking all the time
When the day will come
Standing there before you
Accept this Hajj of mine, Standing in ihram, making my tawaf
Drinking blessings from Your well
The challenge of Safa and Marwa
Rekindles my imaan, O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall, I feel alive and I feel strong
I can feel Islam running through my veins, To see my Muslim brothers, their purpose all the same
Greeting one another, exalting one True Name, I truly hope one day that everyone's a muslim
that they remember you in everything they says
Standing in ihram making my tawaf
Drinking blessings from Your well
The challenge of Safa and Marwa
Rekindles my imaan
O Allah! I am waiting for the call, Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call, Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall"
"It's The Falling In Love Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","Its-The-Falling-In-Love-Lyrics","It's the fallin' in love
that's making me high
it's the being in love that make me cry, cry, cry, You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause..., Bridge
No matter how it starts it ends the same
Someone's always doing someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again, Chorus
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
All night... all night, (Patti Austin)
And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes
Each time I do they kind of burn right through me
Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is saying come and do me, Bridge
Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be
But here I go falling again, Chorus
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
Over you... over you (all night), Chorus
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
All night... all night"

Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing., Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy., No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found., He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders, of His love."

Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby it's all I need, it's all I need, Since the day I've been loving you
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu'
The sweet loving you've been giving me
Has become my daily need, Just a little o' your love, every day
It's all I need, that's all I need

Bring your loving and nothing else, Ooh just a, just a,

"Keep Your Head Up Lyrics","2010","Michael-Jackson","Keep-Your-Head-Up-Lyrics","She's looking for a job and a finer place to stay,
She's looking for the hope in the empty promises
She's working two jobs, keeping alive,
She works in a restaurant night and day,
She waits her life away,
She wipes her tears away.
She cries inside everytime she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside everytime her baby cries, No..., Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly!
Keep your head up, tonight!
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!, Killing up the life in the birds and the trees,
And we're suckin' up the air in the Earth from under me (it's never too late)
I can't even breathe (just lean on me),
I can't even see!
Keep your head up, don't give up, today!
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today!
All you need is love,
I tell you I know it's coming soon
And all you need is just a moment, won't it do
Keep your head up!, Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly (fly away, fly away, fly away)
Keep your head up, tonight!
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my..., Everybody say that time is borrowed,
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
Just give yourself a chance,
Fight the circumstance,
Rise and do it again, Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!, I need your love
I need you now
I need your light right here today
I need you now, Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!"

agenst my window plain
and wonder if you
are watchin snowflakes too
I take a walk downtown
to where you used to meet me
Theres joy everywhere
but all that waiting there is, [Chorus]
Just a little christmas tree
Lookin sorta sad and lonley just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on christmas eve, I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a liitle bear(?)
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is, [Chorus], 
This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you leave me)
(Why did you leave me), [Chorus]"
"Little Susie Lyrics","1995","Michael-Jackson","Little-Susie-Lyrics","Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon..., A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair...
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair..., Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain...
But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair..., It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there..., She knew no one cared..., Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers..., Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair"

And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tendeness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the lonelyness
Thar was waiting there
Spoken:
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me, Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away, (Spoken:)
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now, Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep, (Spoken:)
My heart cries out for your tuch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air, Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone"

Ice-cold water runnin' through my vein
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart's so sad 'cause love's gone bad, I see a rainbow going black
Must be a sign you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night, callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane, I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see?
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me?
Where's the tenderness to comfort me?, Every time some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart's feeling sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad, Black crows flying up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Slime's on the land, slime's on the sea
Slime's not the last thing I'm destined to be, In this whole world where there's nothing right
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool of me
Heart's feeling sad, love's gone bad, Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad..., "

But when you lend my mind
Have an answer now love don't hold me

And the darkness is lighter now
Is my mind I can hear

Goodbye you today, Melodie, you're my symphony

Come in to me
I know mystical garden
Orchards and violets
All mysteries are parted
Life is a mirageghost
Imagination
Pure inspiration called justification, Nothing's impossible
Nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head?
Who creates wonders like nobody can?, Chorus:
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's
Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
I'm gonna...
Siegfried & Roy, When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you, Move of the head
And I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear
From euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening
Nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real, Seeing black panthers
That suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe, [Chorus], 'Cause when it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you, When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true

When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true, Hallucinations
The game of this kind
This kind of magic
Throws mind, [Chorus]"
"Money Lyrics","1995","Michael-Jackson","Money-Lyrics","Money
Money..., Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it, So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust
They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money, So you go to church
Read the holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money, You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the ""Just Few""
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but..., If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it
You do anything for money..., Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil, Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil, Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi?
I don't think so
You don't care
You'd do her for the money
Say it's fair
You sue her for the money, Want your pot of gold
Need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul
Cuz your God is such
You don't care
You kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money, Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttoney and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers...
Cuz they're the backstabbers, If you know it's a lie
Then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt
Then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance
Then you will dare it
You do anything for money, Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil, Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil, Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil, Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil, You say you wouldn't do it
For all the money in the world
I don't think so, If you show me the man
Then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie
Then I will tell him
If you're stealing with God
Then you will hell him
You do anything for money, Anything...
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil, Anything, anything
Anything for money

Keep on dreaming there's nowhere to run
You can drive but you done
I can feel it in the air, hear the monster come., (Too bad)

It's got you bouncing (ooh off the walls)
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood
Just making it clearer, and tell me you like
Don't you, don't you like it, Monster

And sweep this whole land through

Come on shine far all you're worth

Of all faith looking new
Morning glow is long past due, Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
You should have started long ago, Morning glow all days long
For we sing tomorrow's song
Never knew we could be so strong
But now it's very clear
Morning glow is almost here, Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago, Morning glow all your life
We can make the new day right
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last"

Thinking how that things won't be the same
And woudl you like to go with me
And she would answer no to me
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon, I never thought
She'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And would you like to go with me
And she answered no to me
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon, Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would fill with gold, I hope to make a change now
for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And hoping that my prayers will see
The day that you'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson
Much too soon, Yes, I guess I learned my lesson
Much too soon"

No no no no
Never can say goodbye, Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no, Tell me why is it so, That I never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye, Every time I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
That passes me right through the core
It says, ""Turn around, you fool""
You know you'll love her more and more, Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go, I never can say goodbye

Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's that same old, 'Did you hang up?
Can't do with you all the time', Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go, I never can say goodbye, girl

Not since just like the dolla no sense

What's this wanna suck my existence
But still I believe in U and Me
Quite frankly that's how it's supposed to be
That kinda love that could end any poverty
So I keep these ghost like the Kennedy's

Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid, Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart, soft and blue, Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul., In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood, Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat, Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now, Planet Earth, are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void

Held together with a bit of glue

Dance you into day (sunlight)

We're gonna rock the night away, Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us

There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow

A turtleneck sweater
I know the girl

It's Out Of My Hands
To Think For Two Years She Was Here
And I Took Her For Granted I Was So Cavalier
Now The Way That It Stands, She's Out Of My Hands
So I've Learned That Love's Not Possession
And I've Learned That Love Won't Wait, Now I've Learned That Love Needs Expression
But I Learned Too Late
She's Out Of My Life
She's Out Of My Life
Damned Indecision And Cursed Pride
Kept My Love For Her Locked Deep Inside
And It Cuts Like A Knife

"Shout Lyrics","2007","Michael-Jackson","Shout-Lyrics","Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things?, Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me., So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page, Living encased like animals and cannibals
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find, I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now, Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality, Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn, How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds?
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine, We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other
Whatever happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever, Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
The pressure is building and I've had enough
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now"

Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
Sir, ""I must be home tonight""
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind, She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of

A a slave to the rhythm of, The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She's a slave to the rhythm
A a slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love, She works so hard, just to make her way, For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more, But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A a slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love"

"Somebody's Watching Me Lyrics","2017","Michael-Jackson","Somebodys-Watching-Me-Lyrics","(Who's watching me?), I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?, And
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?, When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?, When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair
âE Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much, That's why
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?, (Who's watching me?)
I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
(Who's watching?)
Well is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching?)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now
(Who?!)
The IRS?!, I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?, I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, who can it be?
(Who's watching?), I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?"
"Someone In The Dark Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","Someone-In-The-Dark-Lyrics","Written and composed by Michael Jackson, 
(Opening Version)
All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend, When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you, Promise me we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me, When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me, (Closing Version)
Though you're gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I'll remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears, When someone in the dark reaches out for you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me!"
"Someone Put Your Hand Out Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","Someone-Put-Your-Hand-Out-Lyrics","I'm so undemanding
'Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside
The truth is that I'm longing
For love that's so devine
I search this whole world wishing shell be there
Time after time
Someone Put Your Hand Out, I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
I've lived my life a lonely, A soul that cries of shame
In handicaped emotions save me now
While the wound still remains
I'll be your story hero
I'll serenade in rhyme
I' m just needing at someone save me now
Come out of my mind
Someone Put Your Hand Out, Begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
Someone Put Your Hand Out, (I'm begging for your love)
Begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
When you say we will dance until the light of day, It's just like the children of earth's joy
When we pray
Will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone
Someone Put Your Hand Out, I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
Someone Put Your Hand Out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
Someone Put Your Hand Out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out love"
"Soon as I Get Home Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","Soon-as-I-Get-Home-Lyrics","There's a feeling here inside
That I cannot hide and I know I've tried
But it's turning me around
I'm not sure that I'm aware
If I'm up or down, or here or there
I need both feet on the ground, Maybe I'm just going crazy
Letting myself get up-tight
I'm acting just like a baby
But I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be alright, Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home, In a different place, in a different time
Different people around me
I would like to know of that different world
And how different they find me, And just what's a Wiz, is it big? Will it scare me?
If I ask to leave, will the Wiz even hear me?
How will I know then
If I'll ever get home again?, Here I am alone, though it feels the same
I don't know where I'm going
I'm here on my own and it's not a game
And now a strange wind is blowing, I'm so amazed at the things that I see here
Don't want to be afraid, I just don't wanna be here
In my mind this is clear what am I doing here?
I wish I was home"
"Speechless Lyrics","2001","Michael-Jackson","Speechless-Lyrics","Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel
But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, like ""I love you."""

Stranger In Moscow
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be, How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside, Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a begger boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be, How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)

"That's What Love is Made Of Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","Thats-What-Love-is-Made-Of-Lyrics","You take sugar and spice
Everything nice
And you got a little girl
You take snakes and snails
Some puppy dog tails
And you got a little boy, That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of, Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
Something else to do, You take a walk by the sea
Two hearts on a tree
And you got a little gladness
Blue eyes cry
Two hearts say goodbye
And you got a little sadness, That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of, Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Heart on a tree
Walk by the sea
Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all right, One more thing
You take a cruel word spoken
Pride gets broken
And you got a little break-up
You take a little bit of soul
Sweet words being told
And you got a little make-up, That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of, Words being told
With a little bit of soul
Pride gets broken
Cruel words spoken
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Walk by the sea
Snkaes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all right"

against my window pain
and wonder if you
are watching snowflakes too, I take a walk downtown
to where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
but all that waiting there is, [Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas eve, I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a little prayer
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is, [Chorus], This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you leave me)

Music: charlie smalls, Put your arms around me child,
Like when you bumped your shin;
Then you'll know I love you now,
As I loved you then
Though you may be trying sometimes,
And I'll need you and you're not there;
You know I may get mad and turn away,
But you know that I still care, But you cannot ask for me,
Than can come from me;
I am older than you are,
And one day you'll see, If I lose my patience with you,
And I suddenly start to scream;
It's only because I just want you to be
Everything I see in my dreams, Chorus :
And I'd like to know it's there,
The feeling that we have,
When you know that you can come running to me,
Whenever times are bad, Don't lose the feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have, Though you're growing older now,
And I'm watching you grow;
I know I make you sad sometimes,
And I see your feelings show.
But one day I'll look around,
And you will be grown;
You'll be out in the world,
Such a pretty girl,
But you'll be on your own, Chorus :
And I'd like to know it's there,
The feeling that we have;
Knowing that you can come to me
Whenever you are sad, Child, I'd like to know it's there,
The feel that we have-
Don't lose the feeling that we have.
Don't lose the feeling that we have"

And another ring on another finger, and another grill
And then I switch grills and then I change chains

To tell me what they kids did, yeah
I'mma tell 'em my style and how long I has hated on about it
And how it took twenty minutes to make a song about it
Even though I was young I was actin' grown about it
Took some years, but eventually they left me 'lone about it
Old folks cheering' me on 'cause they know I got it
They see niggas get in the game and fold like origami, But the only foldin' I'm doin' is when I'm at shows poppin'

I give in to this, I give in to that
Every day it bothers me so, Am I in a bad situation
People taking me to the extreme
Am I being used
I just need a clue
I don't know which way to go, So I took my problems to a doctor
So he could check it out, he don't know
Took it to a palm reader so she could
Read my hand, she don't know
Five minutes later I started to understand
I started screaming, shouting, acting mad
No one could help me but myself
But I gave everything I had, It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me, Always wanting something for nothing
Especially what they don't deserve
Reaching in my pocket
I just got to stop it
Even though they got a lot of nerve, Am I in a bad situation
People taking me to the extreme
They don't use rejection
So I need protection
To keep my equity, So I took my problems to a doctor
So he could check it out, he don't know
Took it to a palm reader so she could
Read my hand, she don't know
Five minutes later I started to understand
I started screaming, shouting, acting mad
No one could help me but myself
But I gave everything I had, It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me"

Just a little Christmas tree Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me No one seems to care They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas eve, I hear the Christmas bells

The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a little prayer
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is, [Chorus], Just a little Christmas tree Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me No one seems to care They just went away and left it standing there All alone on Christmas eve, This is the season of love

There were faces starring
Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scarring me, We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls

She walked up to my face
Said this is the place

So this is Heartbreak Hotel

In beguile to hurt me

Got rid of the rocks
Got pits by the door, I've raised other peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers
So I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that

"Threatened Lyrics","2001","Michael-Jackson","Threatened-Lyrics","Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introducing
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster.
You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast, Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed
I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I know just what you said
That's why you've got to be Threatened by me
You should be watching me, you should feel Threatened, Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be Threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, Threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel Threatened by me
You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you, In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under a tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be Threatened by me
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark, A nightmare, that's the case, Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in tow places at the same time
This is judgement night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear.
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.
It isn't. It's the beginning."

"To Make My Father Proud Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","To-Make-My-Father-Proud-Lyrics","To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame,
Not set, the pace for style, If I can follow through
on, what they gave me as my tools,
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools, If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart, Ive done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise,
Shall follow the feel of constant care), In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God, For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
while growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile...

Junto a ti por siempre

Tu voz me llama
Y tú eres quien gana
En mi corazón
Porque me has dado
Algo sagrado

Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estás
No hay felicidad

Si tú te vas

No hay quien me de lo que das tú

Haz que me quiera como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera

Pero siento que
Te quiero y solo vivo por ti

Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Y diremos adiós a la tristeza
Es mi vida y quiero estar junto a ti

She wears black, red and all that, to hide who she is inside
Tomboy, tomboy, tomboy, you are accepted the way you're
There's no one, to tell you otherwise, keep your head up high
Tomboy, tomboy, tomboy, you are moon you are a star
You shine to peoples lives, bring back the the hope and a smiles

Because you can if you want
No one can let you down and tell you can't
To be that you feel in your heart"

Too young to really be in love, They say that love's a word

But can't begin to know the meaning of, And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go, And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all"
"Torture Lyrics","2017","Michael-Jackson","Torture-Lyrics","It was on a street so evil
So bad that even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it, Eyes within the dark were watching
I felt the sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walking
Told me I should not have come there, Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
'Cause I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture, it's torture, it's torture, She was up a stair to nowhere
A room forever I'll remember
She stared as though I should have known her
Tell me what's your pain or pleasure, Every little thing you find here
Is simply for the thrill you're after
Loneliness or hearts of fire
I am here to serve all masters, She said reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
And merciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling
It's torture, it's torture, it's torture, And I still can't find the meaning, no no no
Of the face I keep on seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming
Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel, start the flame in me, Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
And I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture, it's torture, it's torture, It's torture

It's torture"

Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow

Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'telle you in

"We Are The World Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","We-Are-The-World-Lyrics","There comes a time,
When we head a certain call, When the world must come together as one, There are people dying, And it's time to lend a hand to life, The greatest gift of all, We can't go on
Pretending day by day, That someone, somehow will soon make a change, We are all a part of
God's great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need, We are the world
We are the children, We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, There's a choice we're making,
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me, Send them your heart,
So they'll know that someone cares, So there cries for help
Will not be in vein, We can't let them suffer, No we cannot turn away, Right now they need a helping hand, Nou se mond la
We are the Children, We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving, There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives, It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me, When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all, But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall, Well, well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come, When we stand together as one, We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, Got to start giving, There's a choice we're making

Just you and me, We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, Choice were making
saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me, We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
When the earth quakes we'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the World united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the World connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet sing it along, We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me, Everyday citizens
Everybody pitching in, Nou se mond la
Nou se timoun yo, You and I
You and I, Uh, 12 days no water
Wishing will to live, We amplified the love we watching multiply, Feeling like the Worlds end
We can make the World win, Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
and now Haiti needs us, the need us, they need us, We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives

With rain and with sunshine

The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true, 
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few, 
We shall have music
We shal have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time, 
Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and you,

"We've Had Enough Lyrics","2007","Michael-Jackson","Weve-Had-Enough-Lyrics","Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dimlight
From one more violent crime
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did god say that you could decide?
You saw he didn't run
And that my daddy had no gun
In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shakin
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain
He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?
Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids
We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice
Only god could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done
If we raise our voice as one
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us

They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you baby
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Deep in my soul baby
Deep in your soul and let God decide
Deep in my soul
It's up to me and i'm still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
Just let God decide,
It's going on baby
Just let God decide
Deep in my soul baby

For three long years
When no one else wanted you, I took you in and held you near

After you said you'd always stay
How could you be so mean and untrue?
He didn't want you until he'd seen, What my love did for you, yeah

For three long years
Remember how I used to care, When you were down, I dried your tears
Who did you think was the fool?

See That Girl
She Knows I'm Watching
She Likes The Way I Stare, If They Say -
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way
If They Say -
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way
I Like Livin' This Way
I Like Lovin' This Way, Looking Out
Across The Morning
The City's Heart Begins To Beat
Reaching Out
I Touch Her Shoulder
I'm Dreaming Of The Street, If They Say -
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way
If They Say -
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way

When your spirit's on the ground

When you're feeling all alone
Like a child who's got no home
You know you've always got a place where you can go
Just climb on the wings of my love, Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees
As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine, 'Til you break those ties that bind
'Til that day you're really mine
Anytime you want to leave your world behind
Just climb on the wings of my love, I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine, We've got rainbows yet to find
And we'll find them all in time
Girl you know someday we'll even touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love, Anytime you want to leave your world behind

They pin lies on my name, and push them from town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to, find a place
So I won't hide away
Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today, Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships that go away

Went in my personal life and I don't live for you (you)

To turn my upside down back up
You're always there

You're my best friend, my love, my love
You're my best friend, my love
My love you are my best friend, You're my warm when it's cold
You are my sunshine when it rains
And if the rain turns to snow
We'll still be on that friendship train, Cause if our love affair should end (if our love affair should end)
I know I'll never find a friend
As great as you
Girl, I'm glad it's true, [Chorus], Ooh, you're my best friend
Girl there'll be no other
You're my friend and lover

"You're The One Lyrics","2006","Michael-Jackson","Youre-The-One-Lyrics","(with jennifer holliday), When I was a child
I cried on mama's shoulder
She would look at me and say:
When you grow older
You will come to know
The joy and love of one good man
Everything will come in time
If you believe it
Anything you truly want
You can echive it
Picture the love you'll find
With one good man, Some day a price will come your way
He'll smile at you and say
He's waited all his life
For someone like you
And if the love is real
Within you heart you'll feel
I'm yours for life
'cause you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me, Many years have past away since mama told me
I hadn't find a man
To love, to have and hold me
There where many men
But not of them one good man
I began to dout that I would
Find my true love
But then at one noon it happened
I found you, love
You were like a dream come true
You were that one good man, Some day a price will come your way
He'll smile at you and say
He's waited all his life
For someone like you
And if the love is real
Within you heart you'll feel
I'm yours for life
'cause you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me, It's true, I knew from that day on
My lonely days were gone
Those lonely tears I've cried
Since you are by my side
Now and forever more
You'll be with me
And we will love
You are my everything, When I was a child I cried
On mama's shoulder
She would look at me and say:
When you grow older
You'll find a man to love
And now I see that
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me"

giving you an easy game and letting you win

'cos you couldn't keep the great unknown from making you mad
'cos you know you know you know you know

"Alameda Lyrics","2006","Elliot-Smith","Alameda-Lyrics","You walk down Alameda
Shuffling your deck of trick cards over everyone
Like some precious only son
Face down, bow to the champion, You walk down Alameda
Looking at the cracks in the sidewalk
Thinking about your friends
How you maintain all them in
A constant state of suspense, For your own protection over their affection
Nobody broke your heart, You broke your own
Because you can't finish what you start
Walk down Alameda brushing off the nightmares you wish
Could plague me when I'm awake
And now you see your first mistake
Was thinking that you could relate
For one or two minutes she liked you
But the fix is in, You're all pretension
I never pay attention
Nobody broke your heart, You broke your own
Because you can't finish what you start
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own
Because you can't finish what you start
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own
Because you can't finish what you start
Nobody broke your heart
If you're alone it must be you that wants to be apart"

Money to be made
Go on, lose the gamble that's the
History of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play
To zero, And sign up with evil, Angeles?, Don't start me trying now
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, 'Cause I'm all over it, Angeles, I can make you satisfied in
Everything you do
All your secret wishes could right
Now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms

No one's gonna fool around with us

floating over a sea of vodka
separated from the rest
fights problems with bigger problems
sees the ocean fall and rise
counts the waves that somehow didn't hit her
water pouring from her eyes
alcoholic and very bitter, for someone half as smart
you'd be a work of art
you put yourself apart
and I can't help until you start, we knocked another couple back
the dead soldiers lined up on the table
still prepared for an attack
they didn't know they'd been disabled
felt a wave, a rush of blood
you won't be happy 'til the bottle's broken
and you're out swimming in the flood
you kept back you kept unspoken, for someone half as smart
you'd be a work of art
you put yourself apart
and I can't help until you start, you got a look in your eye
when you're saying goodbye
like you wanna say hi, the light was on but it was dim
revolver's been turned over
and now it's ready once again
the radio was playing ""Crimson And Clover""
London Bridge is safe and sound
no matter what you keep repeating
nothing's gonna drag me down
to a death that's not worth cheating, for someone half as smart

you put yourself apart
and I can't help until you start, for someone half as smart

Dragging down the main
The helpless little thing with the dirty mouth
Who's always got something to say
You're sitting around at home now
Waiting for your brother to call
I saw him down in the alley
Having had enough of it all, Said you can do what you want to
Whenever you want to
You can do what you want to
There's no one to stop you, All spit and spite
You're up all night and down every day
A tired man with only hours to go
Just waiting to be taken away
Getting in to the back of a car
For candy from some stranger
Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes
Full of smoldering anger, You can do what you want to
Whenever you want to
You can do what you want to
There's no one to stop you, Now you can do what you want to
Whenever you want to
Do what you want to
Whenever you want to
Do what you want to

Do what I say and I'll make you okay
And drive them away

That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will, I'll keep them still, Drink up baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best

Red white and blue, You look at him like you've never known him
But I know for a fact that you have
The last time you cried
Who'd you think was inside?
Thinking that you were about to come over

and she locked the car and slipped past
into rhythmic quietude
lights burning
voice dry and hoarse
i threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
the chimes fell over each other
i fell onto my knees
the sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
a sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
now i'm picking up to put away anything of your's that's still around
i don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
it'll make a whisper out of you
she took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue
the fairground's lit
a drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
i can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
to take a little nap while the road is straight
i wish that car had never been discovered
they took away the bottle and the hat he was under
that's the one thing that he could never do
and it'll make a whisper out of you
she took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue
cops were running around the scene
looking for some kind of clue
they never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
unless a light bulb really loved him very much
i'm lying down
blowing smoke from my cigarette
little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
you're in your oldsmobile driving by the moon
headlights burning bright ahead of you
and someone's burning out, out on condor avenue
trying to make a whisper out of you
what a shitty thing to say
did you really mean it?
you never said a word to me about what passed between us
so now i'm leaving you alone
you can do whatever the hell you want to
na, na, na, na, na, na."

Is a cloud of smoke
Trying to occupy space.

And take me off far away from you.

it's hard to say

"Pictures Of Me Lyrics","2006","Elliot-Smith","Pictures-Of-Me-Lyrics","Start stop and start
Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks
You say it's just for kicks
You'll be the victim of your
Own dirty tricks
You've got yourself to tease
And displease, Doors swinging wide
You walked in to hide
Looking at your feet
Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the
Coin-op t.v.
Frozen in fear
Everytime we got near, I'm not surprised at all
And really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong, totally wrong, see you walking by, with another guy
Jailer who sells, personal hells,
Who'd like to see me down on
My fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to
Get the disease, I'm not surprised at all
And really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong, totally wrong, I'm not surprised at all
And really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong

Don't want to know where you are
I got a joke I've been
Dying to tell you, A silent kid is looking
Down the barrel
To make the noise that I
Kept so quiet, Kept it from you, Pitseleh, I'm not what's missing
From your life now
I could never be the
Puzzle pieces, They say that God makes problems
Just to see what you could stand
Before you do as the
Devil pleases, Give up the thing you love, No one deserves it, The first time I saw you
I knew it would never last
I'm not half what I
Wish I was, I'm so angry
I don't think it'll ever pass
And I was bad news for you
Just because
I never meant to hurt you"

In a crowded corner where anybody can listen in
But they don't read page to page or speak easy
Now they're gonna go say the words
In the wrong order again, They walk in a circle
Through all the sidewalk scenes they used to be apart of one time
Now everybody just stares and whispers
Driving around up and down Division Street
I used to like it here
It just bums me out to remember, Can't you ever treat anyone nice
I think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
They draw the curtain, wait for a call
Pretty lucky if they get any kind of response at all, Can't you ever treat anyone nice
I think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
I'm gonna make the same mistake twice"

to march down the street like the Duracell bunny
but we get away from the cavalcade
throwing out candy that looks like money
to people passing by
they'd all seem to be going the other way, So won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?, Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
they'd traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar, Ridiculous marching band started playing
got me singing along
with some half-hearted victory song, So won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?, The trumpet has obviously been drinking
cause he's fucking up even the simplest lines
You say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
It's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
When they clean the street, I'll be the only shit that's left behind, So won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?"

A happy day and then you pay
And feel like shit the morning after
But now I feel changed around and instead falling down
I'm standing up the morning after, Situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later, And I could be another fool or an exception to the rule
You tell me the morning after
Crooked spin can't come to rest
I'm damaged bad at best
She'll decide what she wants
I'll probably be the last to know
No one says until it shows and you see how it is
They want you or they don't
Say yes
I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl
Who's still around the morning after"

It's all now to you, there ain't no before
Now that you're big enough to run your own show
You're just somebody that i used to know, I watched you deal in a dying day
And throw a living past away
So you can be sure that you're in control

Long revered options disappear
But I know what to do, Son of Sam, son of a doctor's touch, a nurse's love
Acting under orders from above, King for a day, Son of Sam, son of that shining path, the clouded mind

No one'll know where you are, It's just a brief smile crossing your face
Running speed trials still standing in place, When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child what makes you think you're tough
When all the people you think you're above
They all know what's the matter, You're such a pinball, yeah, you know it's true

Then tomorrow, tomorrow...
They took your life apart and called your failures art
They were wrong though they won't know
'Til tomorrow, I got static in my head, the reflected sound of everything,
Tried to go to where it led, but it didn't lead to anything,
The noise is coming out, and if it's not out now,
I know it's just about to drown tomorrow out"

I've treated you unkindly but can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darlin', won't you please see through me?
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you, You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front, well baby I was hiding
But now I'm so much better with my words coming together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding, I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
Cause you the boy next door and a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember When we were together
And I was singing this song for you, We were alone and
I was singing this song for you"

You gotta call the green man, So I can get mine

To make me attack, So bring me a bag and your man can come back

You gots to call the green man

Left me wanting something new, Physical ain't even my type

So subconsciously on purpose
I left my coat behind, I can't help it, need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too, I hate my alcoholic logic
As I write this on the train
Victoria's Secret in my bag
And my thighs ache again, Last night tips into my mind
Through the puddle in my head
I always get what I want
I think I even said, I can't help, it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too, Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up my loose ends
But I left my jacket with you
And you know my friends, So maybe you will get my number
Or ask them when I'm ached down
But I may have forgotten you
By the next time I'm in town, I can't help, it need to stop it

Throw me scenarios so I tease my self esteem
Though I can talk it through
Really I finally talk
My frustration is released but nothing let em know
And added to that Im sick of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion with my physical release, Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath, Now everywhere I got and I always stare
I justify attraction by your hands, your lips, your hair
And so although I always look I know that I cant touch
And because I can only take a full time man so much
And now I reached a point where I dont care anymore
Its a necessity just like it was before
Many says I ignore the way my body aches
Cause Im the shit I earn I cant look for my sins

There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
'Cause I love a man who doesn't know I exist
Ah and this you can fix so, Cupid, draw back your bow

Nobody else but me, hey, hey, hey

And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me, Now Cupid, if your arrow makes her love strong for me
I swear I'm gonna love her until eternity
I know that 'tween the both of us, her heart we can steal
Cupid, help me if you will so, Cupid, draw back your bow

But I think I was dreaming, he didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips, I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how, Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good, It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so good from behind, he's beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight, I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how, Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear

But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me, Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me, For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go, So...
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me"

Rockin' your F me pumps
And the men notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to, Cause you all look the same everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife, You don't like players that's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers they don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller, You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right, In the morning you're vexed he's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste
Don't be too upset if they call you a skank
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed, You don't like players that's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big ballers don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller, You can't sit down right 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you're lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers, So you did Miami 'cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E, met somebody
And spent the night getting caned, Without girls like you there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you there's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives, Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
that you'd always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps"
"Fool's Gold Lyrics","2007","Amy-Winehouse","Fools-Gold-Lyrics","She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding, For me it aint real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it aint real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told, He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row, She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit, For me it aint real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it aint real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told, Cuz for me it aint real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it aint real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told, So take the gold you find
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band, For me it aint real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it aint real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told, For me it aint real

But you won't get the chance, Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change, Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift, Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change, My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
Somekind of laidback feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So i sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache, Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time

When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her

She is played with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be, Now how can he have her heart

They're much too big, but I don't care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides, nobody can be that wise, I can't help you if you won't help yourself (help yourself, help yourself)
I can't help you if you don't help yourself (help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone else (You can get so much from me)

So you think you cleverer than me (cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (drama queen)
Cause it's where you're at, not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
To hold your head above the sea (keep you high and dry)
And carry you, even though you bigger
Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we're still so young (yeah, I'm so young)
And this isn't yesterday, I can't help you if you won't help yourself, I can't help you

I can't help you if you won't help yourself, You might be twenty-five, but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most of the time
And I, I'm just a child and you full grown
And it was like nothing that I've ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knew"

When you were 15
You wore it to the disco
When everyone was in jeans, But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your low-cut dresses threw stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?, You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pawn all your nice clothes
Just living on dreams, A man in a bright light
Took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom
For a taste unknown, But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?, Hey little rich girl
You've been away for so long (oh)
And now little rich girl
I wrote you in this song (woo woh)
Hey little rich girl
Baby love has gone
And now little rich girl
I know where you belong, At your dad's office party
All the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache
Cos the 'screen-star' was you, You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pull off your nice clothes
Just living on dreams, But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone

Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came, What do you expect? You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely, How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand

I guess he looked like you, No, he wasn't you

Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be

Why we just speak at night

Handle finance wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,

"Love Is a Losing Game Lyrics","2007","Amy-Winehouse","Love-Is-a-Losing-Game-Lyrics","For you I was a flame,
Love is a losing game,
Five story fire as you came,
Love is a losing game., One I wish I never played,
Oh what a mess we made,
And now the final frame,
Love is a losing game,, Played out by the band,
Love is a losing hand,
More than I could stand,
Love is a losing hand,, Self professed, profound,
'til the tips were down,
Though you're a gambling man,
Love is a losing hand,, Tho' I battle blind,
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind,
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds,
And laughed at by the gods,
And now the final frame,
Love is a losing game."
"Lullaby Of Birdland Lyrics","2012","Amy-Winehouse","Lullaby-Of-Birdland-Lyrics","Oh, lullaby by birdland that's what i
Always hear, when you sigh,
Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
In a phrase how i feel, Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo, when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss, And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye, Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love, Lullaby, lullaby, Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss, And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye, Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love"

Pretty baby you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me, I never can behave
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me, crazy music, Music that keeps calling me so very close to you, turns me your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you
So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies, How I worry 'bout you, just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why I'm really feeling in the mood for love, So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again
Baby won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, Now if there's a cloud up above us come on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Ooh my baby won't you please let me love you
And give relief from this awful misery?, What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet?
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before, can't you understand me?
Now baby please pull yourself together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet, Oh baby, you make me feel so good,
Let me take you by the hand
Come let me visit out there in that new promised land
Maybe there we can find a good place to use a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it, never knowin' what love's about

You can blow now if you want to, I'm through"

Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight, before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night, I sung a lullaby every night
Sung for my Ava every night
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan, In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise, With dread, I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoke until one day she couldn't be heard, She spoke until one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan, In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise, Ava was the morning, now she's gone

Birds surround her sweet sound, And Ava flies in paradise

Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground

Should think clear and focus, but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on frank
And I must put that check in the bank, Try to put me in a room

Spare me from worse
In the studio, I will finally burn

Tempted to work, Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity, shout 'till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it
Your words go through
Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression
I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through

Out to be

Always be good

Not be the man some

Of as handsome

"The Girl from Ipanema Lyrics","2011","Amy-Winehouse","The-Girl-from-Ipanema-Lyrics","Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking now
When she passes each one she passes
Goes daboo-du-daa
When she walks she's just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes daboo-du-daa, Oh, but I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day as she walks to the sea, She looks straight ahead, not at me, Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking now
When she passes
I go di-di-do-di
The girl, the girl, the girl
from Ipanema, from Ipanema
Yea I want her so badly
How, how can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile
But she doesn't see.
She ain't looking at me."

"Valerie Lyrics","2008","Amy-Winehouse","Valerie-Lyrics","Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things of what you're doing
In my head I paint a picture, Since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress, Oh, won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?, Valerie, Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house out up for sale?
Did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
Hope you find the right man
Who'll fix it for you, Are you shopping anywhere?
Change the color of your hair
And are you busy?
Did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodging all the time?
Are you still dizzy?, Since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress, Oh, won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?, Valerie, Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water

"Wake Up Alone Lyrics","2007","Amy-Winehouse","Wake-Up-Alone-Lyrics","It's okay in the day, I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying, so just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180, I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets, This face in my dreams seizes my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed, Pour myself over him, moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
If I was my heart I'd rather be restless, Second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
As this ache in my chest, as my day is done now, The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold, I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him, When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight, Drowned in me, we bathe under blue light
His face in my dreams seizes my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him, moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone"

once he was a family man
so surely I would never
ever go through it first hand, Emulate
all the shit my mother hated
I can't help but demonstrate
my Freudian fate, My alibi
for taking your guy
history repeats itself
it fails to die, And animal
aggression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got
I want it all, It's bricked up in my head
it's shoved under my bed
and I question myself again
""What is it about men?"", My destructive side
has grown a mile wide
and I question myself again
""What is it about men?
What is it about men?""
I'm nurturing
I just wanna do my thing
And I'll take the wrong man
as naturally as I sing
And I'll save my tears
for uncovering my fears
our behavioral patterns
that stick over the years
'Cause it's bricked up in my head
it's shoved under my bed
and I question myself again
""What is it about men?""
Now my destructive side
has grown a mile wide
and I question myself again

It depends on what I've been drinkin', Cause everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know What it is, Now-a-days we talk too much
Like your forgetting all the good shit
You decide what? s wrong with me
I always used to let you say, But now I like to think out loud
Your runnin' with some different crowd
We both know what it is, I don't know you anymore
Supposed 2 be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I cant even cry, Mr Ultra sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So Im sorry if I upset you, tomorrow is another day
So Ill call you cause thats OK

Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And you're attitude become a bore
And I'm so Tired
I can't even cry, Relationship doesn't remain
We resonate on different flames
I could cut you down again
If you were like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend, I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man

Dass ich die einzige für dich bin

Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes, Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say, ""when we married,"" 'cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""

We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as a I soap my feet, And then you notice likkle carpet burns

How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah, And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah

Turned up the stereo
About to raise the dead, Slipped in the bathroom
Put some olive oil in my hair
Walked in the closet
Tryin' to find somethin' to wear, Then I checked my email
To see where the party be
Change the names to protect the guilty
And get ready to creep, Should eye bring somebody

So sue me if I go 2 fast
But life is just a party, and parties weren't meant 2 last
War is all around us, my mind says prepare 2 fight
So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen 2 my body tonight, Yeah, they say two thousand zero zero party over,

Lookin' 4 a light that could brighten up a day

This time it was a hurtin' kind

Can't even remember her first name, June brought an Easter bunny
Needless 2 say, hmph, that girl was late
Told a made-up story 2 a busy-body of our only date

Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary
It felt so much, so much like yours
But it only made me, made me want U more

No one else in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and, you are mine and to-
-gether we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry...
One day all 7 will die, All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect, and a savoir-faire
No one else in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and, you are mine and to-
-gether we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die, And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hands she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance, an army's marching feet (Hup 2 3 4 - Hup 2 3 4)
But behold... we will watch them fall, And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, 6 others will curse me
But that's alright (that's alright)
For I will watch them fall (1 2 3 4 5 6 7), All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all

I am yours now and, you are mine and to-

Space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die, (Just how old?), And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their 7 tears, but do not fear
For in the distance, 12 souls from now
You and me will still be here...
We will still be here, There will be a new city with the streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old, and
There will be no death, for with every breath
A voice of many colors sings a song that's so... bold
Sing it while we watch them fall (fall...), All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect, and a savoir-faire
No one else in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and, you are mine and to-
-gether we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry...
One day all 7 will die, (Just how old)
(Just how old)
(Just how old)"

I live in a box of paints
I used 2 be frightened by the devil
And drawn 2 those who weren't afraid
Remember when u told me
That love was touching souls?
Well, surely u touched mine
Part of u pours out of me from time 2 time in these lines
U're in my blood like holy wine... u're so bitter and so sweet
I could drink a case of you darling
And still b on my feet... still be on my feet"
"A Million Days Lyrics","2006","Prince","A-Million-Days-Lyrics","It's only been a hour since you left me
But it feels like a million days
If I had a magic wand I could turn back time
I'd never let you go away, I didn't have the heart to say I'm sorry
Now I haven't got a heart at all
I could tolerate the pain if I could talk to my best friend
But you won't even call
(you wont even call, oh yeah, didn't call me baby), I'm contemplating pulling out my suitcase
And packing everything I own
I didn't back then but I do know now
Wherever you are is home
I'll crawl on my belly and beg you
But your so far away
you've only been gone for an hour
But it seems like a million days (a million days, a million days), It's only been a hour since you left me
I wish I had somebody to blame
But your the perfect picture of what love should look like
And I wanna be your frame
It's only been a hour but it feels like a million days, A million days
One hundred thousand million days
Come home, come home baby
I can't take this no more
Well, come home baby oh yeah
Baby, I know I shouldn't put my faith in heroes
But I can't see you any other way
It's only been a hour since you left me girl
Feels like a million, feels like a million days, Come on home baby."

(A woman's gotta have it)
(A woman's gotta have it), Do the things that keep a smile on her face
Say the words that make her feel better everyday
You betcha better keep on your p's and q's
If you don't, your woman you could easily lose, Oh, I had love, a true love and I lost it
And no one seems to understand
About the pain that it cost me
A woman's gotta have it, I believe, She's got to know that she's needed around
When you kiss her, you got to make her feel it
She wants to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
When you miss her, you got to be 4-realin'
Make her know that she's needed around, Don't take for granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mufflin' word
But she's got to know that her voice is heard, Oh, I had love, a true love and I lost it
And no one seems to understand
About the pain that it cost me
A woman's gotta have it, I believe that I should know, She's got to know that she's needed around
When you kiss her, you got to make her feel it
She wants to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
When you miss her, you got to be 4-realin'
Make her know that she's needed around, Oh, I had love, a true love and I lost it
Now I'm sufferin' all this pain
That the true love cost me
A woman's gotta have it, I believe that I should know, She's got to know that she's needed around

Looking to be proud, dirty projects
Hoping, hungry, feed my stomach

This one will serve us better,
If you choose to be my girl, Like Zuzu's petals,
A wonderful life, the two of us shall lead,

Spiritual food they need, The secrets that the ones before
With grace, they've come and shown
2gether with love 4 one another
We shall make them known, With the love and happy days (?)

Darling, darling, u should've been there
Cuz all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4, Remember the time we swam naked
In your father's pool?
Boy he was upset that night
But boy was that ever cool, Remember the night we played pokeno 4 money
And u robbed me blind
Remember how u used 2 scream so loud
Cuz u hated that number 9, Hey, I saw your sister skating on the lake
This afternoon
Good Heaven how she's grown
She swoons the boy skaters she's so tall, But of all your father's children
All your father's children, baby
U know, u are the finest of them all
U are brighter than the northern star, Last night I spent another lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, u, u should've been there
U see, of all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4
Yeah, My momma used 2 say
Always trust your lover
Now I guess that only applies 2 her
Cuz baby u promised me
Baby u promised me u'd never leave
Then u died on the 25th day of December
Oh baby, Last night I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, baby, u, u should've been there
Cuz all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4
Yeah, Your father said it was pnemonia
Your mother said it was strep
But the doctor said u were dead
And I, I say its senseless, Every Christmas night 4 7 years now
I drink banana daquaris 'til I'm blind
As long as I can hear u smilin' baby
U won't hear my tears
Another lonely Christmas is mine
Yeah, mine
Yeah
Another lonely Christmas is mine, Last night, yeah, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, u should've been there, yeah
Cuz all the 1's I dream about

Come take this bitter cup from me, If I were ever 2 write my life story
I could truly say through all the pain and glory
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand
Cause when U whispered in my ear
The words I so now understand, oh..., Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day b4
Cause U made me confess that I am...
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U're free U're really free indeed
All U gotta do is just plant the seed, Everything U made U said, ""That's good""
B4 the fall of man U said, ""That's good""
Everytime I walk in faith, that's good
U let me see another day, that's good
B4 the earth was made U said,
""Tamar, I will lead the way and U'll go far""
Knowledge and understanding
Understanding is good
And when I wake up in the morning
All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're..., Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U rescue me from the darkness
and our heart just must confess
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U're free U're free indeed
All U gotta do is just plant the seed, Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave Ur hands in the air and say
Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave Ur hands in the air and say, Beautiful, loved and blessed
U rescued me from the darkness in the wilderness
But I am beautiful, loved and blessed
No matter what the challenge
I always pass the test, That's what I am, beautiful
That's what I am, beautiful
I don't mean 2 put nobody down
Still I must confess that I am...
Beautiful, that's what I am
That's what I am
When U wanna give up, don't cause U know
U always got a friend, That's what I am, that's what i am
Thats' what I am
Beautiful, beautiful
That's what I am, that's what i am
Thats' what I am
Beautiful, beautiful
oh yeah, oh yeah
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful"
"Beginning Endlessly Lyrics","2010","Prince","Beginning-Endlessly-Lyrics","Nevermind the bird feed honey, just tell me your name
You wont have that long if I get my way in this game
My reputation precedes me, call it claim to fame
They know me around the world, you want me just the same, [Chorus:]
Why should you be satisfied with just heaven and earth?
When if you look around there's so much more to the universe
Maybe every shining star, is just another part
If you and I could ever open up our dirty hearts, (Oh! Open up baby. Oh. Hey-hey ...), Listen, All of us in minerals and chemicals of space
You cary within your womb, that's how we got to this place
This might be a bit serious, but if it turns you on
Come with me now let's get nice till serious is gone, [Chorus], (Oh! Come on! Oh! Oh. Get nice.), Love is much to small a word for what you feel for me
If you ever let me explore your anatomy
You and I lost in each other prisoners let free
Come on Darlin' let's get down beginning endlessly, (Uh uh. Let's get down! Uh uh. Beginning endlessly
Uh uh. Let's get down! Whooh!), Come on! You see that I want ya. Ooh wee!
Come on! Can't you see that I want ya. Feel me now!, History is full of praise for another's history
More and more than the one that became before both u and me
Left alone with our devices, whatever will be will be, A brand new story in the making beginning endlessly, (Oh!), Love is much to small a word, for what you feel for me
(Feel for me)
If ever you you let me be, let me be your man
Ooh baby! Understand. I wanna I wanna be your man
(Get on down!)
(Come on!)
(Ah, ah-ah)
(Come on! Come on!)

"Better with Time Lyrics","2016","Prince","Better-with-Time-Lyrics","This might seem strange
Since so much time has passed
And since only one of us
Still looks the same
Your words not mine, baby
You are still fine yes you are
Like wine, you get better with time
So young and so naive
That eI never once believed
That the memory of you would go thru
Like wind goes thru the trees, Maybe if you believe baby
That I would no deceive you
U and I side by side or somewhere
In between, I don't know if this is a bore
But I just can no longer ignore
This fact so sublime
You get better with time, Anyone who's met you agrees
That no one forgets you most of all not me
You can claim you're humble and hide
But when it's true my dear
It's not pride, A jury of my peers would find me
Guilty of so many crimes
If I chose not to remind you
That you get better with time, This might seem absurd
to someone so cultured
And to one who would grace any stage, When the hair that frames that face
Dark brown or silvery lace
What is age but a cage? Never mind
You'll be blind to not know that you get better with time"

Everything is looking up when you're this low to the ground
It's bout time
Everybody's on the take
Let's get a big brush and paint this town, The night is young...
Much younger than we are
Let's kiss the night
Away in a fast car, Where ever we are it's a big city
Dirty little hotel room or working on a farm
If everybody is a star - to me - you're the most pretty
I'm in da big city (and me), da big city, da big city
When I'm in your arms, Everybody's getting money instead of getting saved
Not you and me honey we already gave
Just as long as eye got you don't care come what may..., (Well. she's in da big city), Eye just came to tell y'all
From the darkest desperation to the highest bliss
Power to the one's aware of the bigger than this!
Big city uh. where's my guitar?
What's going on? everything good, Where ever we are it's a big city

can I talk to you
what I got to share
is mighty good news
a brand new day is dawning
U and me know what to do
so much work to do, Black Muse
we've been so abused
Our mothers were good looking
and our fathers were too
if they don't stay together
we can walk no better in these shoes
Black Muse, long ago 2 men held one of us down
another took a whippin'
Made a terrible sound
a baby watch her father
falling down to the ground
that was you... and me., Black Muse
can I share with you
just came this morning
and it's mighty good news
they tipped the hour glass
now everything is past
it's true..., they gave the world back to u and me
the faces on the mountains
and the dirty sea
a trillion dollar bill
and no currency
still will we believe, Black Muse
we gon' make it thru
surly people that created
rhythm and blues
rock & roll and jazz
so u know we're built to last
it's cooool, it's cooool, it's cooool
black muse, a new day is coming
black muuuse
a new day is dawning
black muuuse, now that I got your attention
I think its 'bout time I mention
the reason why i wrote this song
like a UFO sighting
from my heart I am writing
the next close encounter
well, tell me how long
will it be on land or near the water
will it produce the star
of a black moon daughter
or a pillow covered with all our tears
one thousand light years away from here
one thousand light years from here, no yesterday or tomorrow
no better remedy for sorrow
then why the fifth held forever
will make you cry
I don't know why, one thousand light years from here
one thousand light years from here, two unbroken circles
joined together
make a butterfly
little darling
don't u wanna try
there ain't nothing better than
looking for me and seeing u in the mirror
one thousand light years away from here, why do we always seem so far away
when u know that I really
wanna be with u night and day
running out of ways to say how
so I think I'll just close for now."

Maybe we should roll 2 the rock and rumble

"Call My Name Lyrics","2006","Prince","Call-My-Name-Lyrics","Call, call my name
Call it, call my name, Heard your voice this morning, calling out my name,
It had been so long since I heard it, that it didn't really sound quite the same, no
But it let me know, that my name had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door,, And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you,
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth, (Chorus)
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl,
I might go insane
I know it's only been about 3 hours
But I love it when you call my name, I heard a voice on the news saying people want to stop the war (stop the war)
If they had a love as sweet as you they'd forget what they were fighting for,
What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free? Somebody lied
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside, (Chorus), I've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you,
It let me know I'd never seen the moon before,
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws,
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause
Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real
God forbid if you belonged to another I'd have to steal you
I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law round here
Because your beauty, it gives one pause
It slows me down, (Chorus)"

I dunno, come on, Chelsea, I dunno, come on
Go ahead now, Chelsea, go ahead now
This for Jersey right here, go ahead now, Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
Kept her tears up in a bottle
She poured them out to save her soul, Ask her what she liked the most
She said she liked to talk to Jimi's ghost
Fantasy, a bragger's boast
Chelsea's fly like coast to coast, Hollywood or Times Square
If the party's fly, my girl is there
Earth boots on and flowers in her hair
21st Century hippie, Chelsea don't care, Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
She kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul, Try to catch her if you can
But you never see her with one man
'Cause they must be baptized according to the master plan
Before she give up the good thang, go 'head Chelsea, No blood diamonds or designer chic
'Cause she's too original from her head down to her feet
You can hate if you want to, Chelsea don't eat no meat
Still got butt like a letter C, go 'head Chelsea, Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
She kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul, Come on, Chelsea
Come on, Next to her, they just a fool
Chelsea read more books than a few
Like Moses was a Pharaoh in the 18th Dynasty
And Rome was chilling in Carthage in 33 BCE, And the day that we stop counting
We live as long as a tree
Go ahead Chelsea, teach me
Go ahead Chelsea, Make a promise to your higher self
Get true knowledge then fame and wealth
Then you don't be chasing nobody's ghost
Of everything make the most, come on, Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
She kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul, Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
Kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul, Come on Chelsea
Keep that body moving
Come on Chelsea
Make that body move, Come on Chelsea
Keep that body moving
Come on Chelsea
Make that body move, Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice, Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
Kept her tears up in a bottle

Maybe I'll die young like heroes die
Maybe I'll kiss you some wild special way
If nobody kills me or thrills me soon,
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon, If that's alright, Lovers like us dear are born to die
If they don't find us what will we do?
I guess we'll make love under the cherry moon

"Clouds Lyrics","2014","Prince","Clouds-Lyrics","You should never underestimate the power of
A kiss on the neck, when she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck, when she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck
And every time you catch her singin' in the shower
You should go and get a flower
Don't matter what the hour
Just rub it on her back, rub it on her back, rub it on her back, In this brand new age we do everything
Quick, fast, in a hurry
All of our life's a stage
Everybody stars, reality so blurry
If you scream out loud, loud
Top of your voice be higher than the crowd (no)
Tattoo-less and proud, yeah
We'll get to something higher that doesn't require clouds
No, we don't need no clouds, no, You should never underestimate the power of

All over me, I'm gonna give you something baby
But I wonder does it really even matter if it ain't on a stage
If it ain't on a stage
I don't really think it matters in this brand new age, When life's a stage, in this brand new age
How do we engage?
Bullying just for fun
No wonder there's so many guns
Maybe we're better off in space, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Nelson, can you hear my voice?
Sir, we know you're a little bit groggy
And you're probably going to find it hard to speak
But don't try to talk or process too much now
We just want to let you know that the medication you were given
Has put you in a suspended animation for quite some time
Well, in fact, about 45 years
But where you are now
Is a place that doesn't require time
That saying, you are completely safe
And we are here to help you, You should never underestimate the power of
A kiss on the neck, when she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck, when she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck, It's in my power to love you
It's in my power to love you up
It's in my power to love you, It's in my power to love you up"

Under which the colonized fall
Without God, it's just the blind leading the blind, Upload, a joint venture record deal

While he's sticking you with the bill

Of fleeting fame and fortune

Become the rule of law

Heat up, melt down, and thaw, When the greedy one forgets
That he's the reason for it all
The only gold that's so worth stashing, Compassion

Who insisted that he love her
Then left him 4 a real prince
From Arabia, now isn't that
A shame that sometimes money
Buys U everything and nothing

Terminal condition of the heart, Thinking about U driving me crazy
My friends all say it's just a phase, but ooh-ooh
Every day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard
There was a woman from the ghetto
Who made funny faces just like
Clara Bow, how was I 2 know
That she would wear the same
Cologne as U and giggle the same
Giggle that U do?
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool
With a condition of the heart, Thinking about U driving me crazy

I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind, She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind, Nikki, The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind, Darlin' Nikki, Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you 4 a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind, Oh, Nikki, ohhhh, come back Nikki, come back

Let's go, Negroes from Brooklyn play the bass pretty good

And the 2 and fro is funky when the grease is dead on it
Funky dead on it
Uh, dead on it

And I'm rockin' that stupid shit , Rollin' in my deuce deuce 5 
Convertible top down so I can see the honeys passin' me by 
It's a beautiful day in my neighborhood 
But 5 or 10 minutes, a criminal puts me in a bad mood 
And some would say that's just a black man's perspective 
But nowaday, I find that it's reflective 
Of what I see goin' down everyday 
My brothers and my sisters gettin' played 
So we revert 2 committin' dope, many brothers get hurt 
By another brother who don't like salt in his dirt 
Cuz in the streets, see, that's the way it is 
U keep your mouth shut and stay out of other people's biz 
See, the system wasn't made 4 me or U 
And as a matter of fact, it wasn't made 4 a poor white who... 
Gets their weekly hit 
Or should I say that weekly check and start depending on that shit like a glass dick 
These are some of the feelings that I'm holdin' 
But everything's fine while I'm rollin'... , CHORUS , (Don't everyday) , How many, how many times must we commit crimes 
Against people no better off than us, but in our own minds? 
A-havin' it, grabbin' it, tastin' it 
And when U step off, I finally rub your face in it 
See, the local's preacher is not suited 4 the have-nots 
The poor get poorer and the rich continue 2 clock ... not! 
That means U end up with the booty 
And we all know a broke man is a man with no friends 
And that's basically the way society is 
And money talk, pusher walk and sleepin' on the politics 
Soon we must live 2 consolidate 
As we continue 2 consume instead of producin', seal our on fate 
(In my deuce and a quarter feelin' funky funky fine) 
People right now really don't give a damn 
(And I'm rockin' that stupid shit) 
Cuz in the 20 mile radius, there's probably not one black and... 
Hispanic taken 4 granted and left 2 clean their own shit up, huh 
No need 4 panic, I'm out 
That's bullshit! , CHORUS , In my... in my... in my...

I'm over 30 & I don't smoke weed

aint the type of stereo U're tryin to feed

I use proper English & I'm straight
I'm in the news again for paying dues my friend
And not the type of ganda U prop in my way
Don't play me, Don't play me
I've been to the mountain top & it aint what U say
Don't play me, Don't play me
I'm the wrong color & I play guitar
My only competition is well in the past
Time & time if time existed movin ever so fast
Don't play me, U couldn't play enough of me now
2 make me feel like a star
Don't play me I already do in my car
Don't play me, Don't be mad at me
The curtain puller in the game
Maybe how U call us Niggers aint the same
It's all good when u know the only fame
Is the light that comes from God & the joy U get to say his name
Don't play me, Don't play me
I've seen to the mountain top & it aint what U say
Don't play me, Already got laid"

"Dorothy Parker Lyrics","2006","Prince","Dorothy-Parker-Lyrics","Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered - ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't 2 hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said ""Sounds like a real man 2 me""
Kinda cute, U wanna take a bath?
(do you wanna, do you wanna, bath)
I said ""Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on"" (she say)
""'cause I'm kind of going with someone""
She said ""Sounds like a real man 2 me""
""Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song"" she said
And it was Joni singing ""Help me I think I'm falling""
(Ring)
The phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as U"", 
Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
'cause she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back
2 the violent room (tell us what U did)
Let me tell U what I did..., I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker

Listen 2 the story of a man I am not, Party all night, hangin' out
In the streets more than I be at home
I take a pill 2 wipe away my doubts
But a pill can't cure my bein' alone
Vodka and 7 straight 2 my brain
Put me under false impressions, hide all my pain
Somebody help me, I'm losing control, This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!, Everybody got the big dreams (Hey Lordy)
But nobody got the bucks
Love and trust will help U make it in a world (Everybody)
Where there ain't no love, ain't no love, Dig...
A man came up 2 me, smile in his eyes
He told me I was a saint
So I'm quittin' my friends much 2 their surprise
I can't live up 2 the picture that they paint
Ah somebody help me, I'm losing control (Ow!), I guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!, Lordy

"Dreamer Lyrics","2016","Prince","Dreamer-Lyrics","I was born, raised on a slave plantation
In the United States, of the red, white and blue
Never knew that I was different, till Dr. King was on a balcony
Lyin' in a bloody pool
I expected so much more from a loving
A loving, loving society
A truthful explanation, you know what
I got another, another conspiracy, If it was just a dream, listen, call me, call me a dreamer too, With more rewards and accolades, then anyone before or after
21st century, oh what a shame, what a shame
Race, race still matters
A race to what, and where we going
We in the same boat, but I'm the only one rowing, Last time I checked, you were sleeping, but you can call me a dreamer too
(What's up with this), Peanut butter logic, served on a bed of lies
Don't go down too easy, when you've seen your father cry
Have you ever clutched the steering wheel in your car too tight
Praying that police sirens just pass you by that night
While the helicopter circles us, this theory's getting deep
Think they're spraying chemicals over the city
While we sleep, Come on, I'm staying awake
you can call me a dreamer too

When I'm alone in my room
I can't stop dreaming about U, dreaming about U
And every time I do what I need 2 do
I can't stop dreaming about U, dreaming about U, Revolving around every word that is spoken
Like the planets around the sun
I want U
Your tongue is a great persuader
Yeah, U got me sold
And when I'm alone in my room just watching a rose
I dream about U, I dream about U, When I'm alone in my room, yeah

When I'm alone in my room, baby, baby
I can't stop dreaming about U, dreaming about U
And every time I do what I need 2 do
I can't stop dreaming about U, dreaming about U, When my sane twin reigns
Claiming your aim is 2 maim my subconscious into being with U
I dream about U
Betting on the notion that if my lustier twin prevails
Like the ruins of Rome, I'll lie helpless at your feet
Yeah, when I'm alone
I dream about U, I dream about U, I dream about U, baby
When I'm alone in my room
I dream about U, my baby
I dream about U, U, U, (And here we stand)
And here we stand amidst your core (U)
Like the petals on this rose I adore (U)
The inside (The inside)
If the inside is kind
Kind in a sense that one would come from all
And the wish that U wish will come true if U call
But if not, (U will fall) U will fall
And I'll still be alone (Just dreaming about U)
With this ball in my stomach just dreaming about U (Dreaming about U)"

U have just accessed the Akashic Records Genetic Information Division.
This program is required 4 those wishing 2 obtain
a marriage blessing from the kingdom.
When U wish 2 begin this program, place your right hand
on the scanner and tightly clench up your buttcheeks as U might feel a
slight electrical shock.
Please select the race history U desire.
U have selected ""African-American"".
This is your history:, First of all, the term ""black and white"" is a fallacy.
It simply is another way of saying ""this or that"".
Let's examine the term ""this or that"" in its ultimate form
which is: ""this"" means the truth or ""that"" which is resistant 2 it., When a minority realizes its similarities on a higher level
not just ""black"", but ""people of color"", and higher still ""indigenous"", and even higher still, ""from the tribe of"", and yet higher:
""The Rainbow Children"".
When this understanding comes, the so-called minority becomes a majority in the wink of an eye.
This action will cause a reaction or resistance.
The source of this resistance must be banished as it is in direct conflict with the initial action.
It cannot be assimilated, 4 its very nature is resistance.
In other words, one cannot serve 2 masters.
U are either ""this"" or ""that which is not this""., End of part one.
2 continue, select the program ""Family Name"" and type in the
current government name U wish history on., London, England, sometime in the early 1600's:, We have the God-given right 2 run out of our colony anyone
who does not bow down 2 our law

Come on, now
What's your name boy?
Abu, Abu Cah
Well, it ain't now, it's Tom Lynch, Mirror, mirror what U see?
Have I still got those dark clouds over me?
Or am I really feeling what I feel?
The last days of the devil's deal
Oh mirror, what U see?, Devil, devil what U know?
U been here since 1914, but now U got 2 go
U been hidin' behind corporate eyes
U wanna war, but U can't fight
Oh devil, oh, U got 2 go, yes sir!, Bridge...
U might say, ""what U mad about?""
But U still got your family name
Pleased 2 meet U, Mr. Rosenbloom
I'll be John Blackwell just the same
What's your family name?, Teacher, teacher what U say?
Did we really come over in a boat?
Did it really go down that way?
Or did I arrive before U and ruin Thanksgiving Day?
Oh teacher, oh, what U say?, Preacher, preacher is it true?
That Jesus wants me 2 give my money 2 the likes of U?
Ride around in your Lexus coupe
Drive us 2 the cleaners in a pinstripe suit
Oh preacher, that ain't truth!, The bridge, huh...
U might say, ""what U mad about?
But U still got your family name
Pleased 2 meet U, Mr. Pearlman
U can call me ""Clay""
Now can I play?, People, people what's your name?
Maybe we should start all over
Let everybody get in the game
Put up a one-gloved fist
Make a sound, Violet Brown, U might say ""what U mad about?""
But U still got your family name

The rapper that gave that head will thank his manager b4 the lord

Gotta catch my breath, gotta loosen up for you,

And bump into each other on bumper cars.
The night is young,
And so are we,
We'll be seventeen forever 'till were '93.
We can last forever, we can last a lifetime;
Just me and you, You took one step, two step, three closer to me;
And I'm shakin' like a leaf on a maple tree.
I wipe the sweat off my brow, gotta straighten up;
Gotta catch my breath, gotta loosen up for you,
For you,
For you,
For you,
For you."

In the water U'll drown (Freaks on this side, the freaks on this

But the lost is found (Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side), Come on, baby, When confusion tries 2 tear your world apart
And the demons fight 4 power
That's the time U got 2 listen 2 your heart
No one knows the final hour, CHORUS, When U see an illusion everywhere U look
When U know the process of creation
When U understand everything in every book
Congratulations - U're in the New Power Generation!, (Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side) {x4}
The freaks on this side! {x3}, When everybody calls the truth by a different name
And the indifference between us still remains
God is Love, Love is God - simple and plain
Party in this way, there's so much more 2 gain, (Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side) {repeat 2 end}, (Get on down, down, down, down, down)
Freaks on this side

But there ain't no fury like a woman scorned, Y'all musta dug it when U did your thang
It's like the song everybody wanna sang
When the music's over your ears'll ring
With a voice that says ""Queen got no king""
Got no king, (No, she don't), He got a message sayin' U tried 2 reach him on the phone
He didn't wanna answer cuz he's so afraid
U'll probably tell him just 2 leave U alone, U must have heard he got another band
They're makin' money, they're makin' plans
U feel left out, but U need 2 understand
Word on the street - he's still your man
He's still your man, he's still your man, girl, (Look out, look out) Look out here comes your rainy day
Now U think U got a good reason 2 say
Everything that's in your heart, come what may
Even though his might get broken, Who's the guilty 1, (who's the guilty 1) when there ain't no judge and jury?
Shadow 2 the sun (shadow 2 the sun), next 2 the 1 (next 2 the 1)
Hell ain't got no fury, Will the roses the dead keep sending
Repair the heart in need of mending?
Will this song have a happy ending?
Only the woman knows, only she knows, 2 sides 2 every story
One man's gloom is another man's glory
Sun 2 a shadow (shadow), rose 2 a thorn (rose 2 a thorn)

Could it be that I was looking for you?
They were cool but something wasn't right
They had me fooled for a minute and then I saw the truth, None of them got what it takes to be a future baby mama
Gotta bend in the wind but don't break to keep your man
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine with no more drama
Future baby mama, I've heard it said that I won't treat you right
But they ain't sure 'cos they don't know nothing about you
You're too secure to ever want to fuss and fight
That's why your man never ever got a reason to doubt you, None of them got what it takes to be a future baby mama
Bend in the wind but don't break to keep your man
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine, no more drama
Future baby mama, Yeah, I know you might be fine but I've seen it all before
Cinderella was a waste of time and oops, she's out the door
To build a house together, the thing that matters more
Is under the floor, a strong foundation that last forever more, I'm gon' to make you happy, baby, happier than happy itself
You know what? If you'll ever need a hand, call me, I'll help
'Cos I got you, anywhere you wanna go
Paris, London, Africa, San Lucas, Mexico, you see, I know what you want, what every good woman wants
A man so in love with you, he can't help but to flaunt you
Deep down, I know what you want
You want your girlfriends to hate you 'cos they can't get your man, None of them got what it takes to be a future baby mama
Gotta bend in the wind but don't break to keep your man
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine, no more drama

That I was flying for the first time
And in the dream I could pilot my flight

Everybody was all around
When we sang, we all sang together
Oh, what a beautiful sound, Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song, I had a dream last night
That I was singing and the sound of my voice
Seemed to come from every mountain top
Like it had no choice, And when my voice rose, so did the sun
When the trees sang the harmony as one
Every living soul sang the most beautiful
Melody ever sung, Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song, Before the war the only words and language said
Let there be light
Those that can see it are the ones who believe it
And put up no fight, And in the absence of fear and control
Is the sound of the surrendering soul
Louder than the dogmatic persecution
I sing it like you got that right, Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song, Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la

Get wild! {x4}, When U're sick of that 9 2 5
And U're ready 2 come alive
When U look both high and low
And U can't find a trumpet that blows, Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the good times never die
Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the damsels good and fly
Come on baby, U can shake your funky monkey 'til it cry
Polyvinyl acetate will keep your monkey high
If U wanna get real freaky, now's the time 2 try (Come on y'all), CHORUS:
Get wild! - Everybody up in the place
Get wild! - It don't matter what sex or race
Get wild! - All U nasty girls and boys
If U wanna get wild, say yeah (Yeah!) - Make some noise!, When U want 2 get in the groove
But the music don't make U move
Hip the DJ 2 a new CD
Anything by the N.P.G., Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the good times never die
Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the damsels good and fly
Come on baby, U can shake your funky monkey 'til it cry
Polyvinyl acetate will keep your monkey high
If U wanna get real freaky, now's the time 2 try (Come on y'all), CHORUS, Get wild!
Like U know U need 2
Pick a funky outfit short and see through
Versace got it going on in the gold mesh
Why don't U try it on 2 night when U get dressed?
Get Wild's the only aroma that my nose will see (Get wild!)
Why don't U spray a little where U think I'm gonna be?
And U know, U know what shoes 2 wear
The ones so high U're scared, Ououo, peligro que aqui yo vengo! {Oh oh, danger 4 here I come!}
(Get wild!), When U can't find the G 2 your GO
Even charged, your battery's low
When the smoke's 2 thick 2 blow
There's a brand new high we know, Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the good times never die
Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the damsels good and fly
Come on baby, U can shake your funky monkey 'til it cry
Polyvinyl acetate will keep your monkey high
If U wanna get real freaky, now's the time 2 try (Come on y'all), Get wild! - Everybody up in the place, yes
Get wild! - It don't matter what sex or race
Get wild! - All U nasty girls and boys (Get wild!)
If U wanna get wild, say yeah (Yeah!) - Make some noise!, Get wild! (Shake it!)
Shake your money maker
Get wild! (Shake it!)
Shake your money maker
Get wild! (Shake it!) (Shake it!)

Give it up and go
To the place in everyone's future
The good life, one day, we'll know

You know where to find this brother
Uptown, at every movie show
Outta my life, to another, That was the only thing that I wanted to do
That was my drug of choice
Left all the funny smellin' cigarettes
To the American boys, 'La Dolce Vita', was the knob that turned me on
Marcello Mastroianni's Italian Mac comin' on strong
He had all the honeys, the kind from the magazines
Small waist, big-right, biggest ones you've ever seen, The good life, good life

Went to school by day

Your future map out your steps
And make sure no one dies, The good life

"Goodbye Lyrics","2006","Prince","Goodbye-Lyrics","Last night when I left U fast asleeping
I should have contemplated suicide
4 the smile upon your face that's well worth keeping
By morning - smears 4 every tear U cry
I could manage a week or 2 without those kisses
It'd be hard, but something tells me I could try, CHORUS:
4 that matter, whatever 2 make U reconsider
Is there truth when U make love 2 a lie?
Excuse me, but is this really goodbye?, Why'd I ever let U in this morning?
Why'd I let U come inside my door?
I should have known without that smile adorning
Your face - a kiss was not what U came 4
That's when your hand reached out 2 touch me gently
At least that's how it happened in my mind, CHORUS, Can't begin 2 understand how I think about U (Everything)
Everything I wanna do, I cannot do without U
However wrong U want - I'll be
Just please (please) don't leave (Don't leave)
If it means this life without U, baby
I swear I'll spend it on my knees
Excuse me, but is this really goodbye?, Last night when I left U I was so sure
We'd be 2gether 4ever and 4 days
And now my shade of blue couldn't get no bluer
I don't even know what I did 2 make U go away
I could possibly stage a front and play the cool one (Cool one)
Heart in my hand tryin' 2 hold back every cry, But who would applaud me when it's U, my one and only
Who ever gave me a good reason not 2 die
Excuse me, but is this really... (Goodbye)
Excuse me, but is this really... (Goodbye)
Excuse me, but is this really goodbye?

Prince gonna get you high, CHORUS:
I'll get you high yeah

Making your way through the neighborhood
Looking for some good boys, toys
Bobbin' your tail 2 another one of Prince's jams
Trying to look real coy
when they pull up right beside you
and ask if they can ride you
(Check, where the party at?)
The horn goes beep
The music in the jeep goes, I got the music to get you high again
I got the beat that make you act like a hooligan
I got the rhyme, make you tell a friend
Prince gonna get you high, CHORUS, Every now and then, you're havin' one of them days
People gettin' on your last nerve, ooh
No matter how you cut it, nothing seems to go your way
You wanna quit this job
Get your swerve on, turn the radio up
It's a new day, the only way to see it is your way
The door goes slam
Now you sing this jam (Go), I got the music to get you high again
Got the beat that make U act like a hooligan
Got the rhyme, make you tell a friend
Prince gonna get you high, NPG ahdio getting you high again, CHORUS"

Do U wish 2 change your entry?
Very well, please enjoy your experience, I never thought that U would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
U gave your body 2 another in the name of fun
I hope U had some baby, if not, boo hoo
CHORUS:
It's so sad but I hate U like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate U - Now everyday would be a waste of time
Cuz I hate U
I never thought that I could feel this way
2 fall in love was a table reserved 4 fools
Say U're sorry if U wanna but it's all in vain
I'm out the door sweet baby, that's right, we're through
CHORUS
This court is now in session
Would the defendant please rise?
State your name 4 the court
Never mind (Billy Jack Bitch)
U're being charged with one 2 many counts of heartbreaking
In the 1st degree
I don't give a damn about the others
My main concern is U and me
Your honor, may I call 2 the stand my one and only witness?
A girl that know damn well she didn't have no damn business
I know what U did, how U did it and uh. who U did it with
So U might as well plead guilty cuz U sure can't plead the 5th
Now raise your right hand
Do U swear 2 tell the whole truth
Not the half truth like U used 2 so help U God?
Nod your head one time if U hear me
If U don't, I'll have 2 use the rod
Anything 2 make U see that uh. U're gonna miss me
Yeah, U're gonna miss me
Uh, uh, uh, oh!
If it please the court
I'd like 2 have the defendant place her hands behind her back
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act
The act of showing her how good it used 2 be
I want it 2 be so good she falls back in love with me
Close your eyes
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want U 2 pump your hips like U used 2
And, baby, U better stay on the beat
Did U do 2 your other man the same things that U did 2 me?
Right now I hate U so much I wanna make love until U see
That it's killin' me, baby, 2 be without U
Cuz all I ever wanted 2 do was 2 be with U ... ow!
I hate U (I hate U)
Because I love U (Because I love U)
But I can't love U (I can't love U)
Because I hate U (I hate U)
Because I love U
I love U, baby
I love U {x3}
I love U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind

Maybe they don't hold me like she does (No they don't!)
No, it's unbearable
I wonder if she knows that I've turned down their hug and kissin'
Cuz it's her that I'm missin'
I wonder if she really knows, I wonder, CHORUS:
I wonder if she knows how much I love her
I wonder if she knows how much I need her face around
I wonder if she cares about me, I wonder, Well, go on and get it one time
Well, well, well, well, Maybe she'll come on Monday, then again maybe not
Maybe she'll let me get her excited, get her sweaty, get her hot
I wonder if I'll finally do what I've been dreamin' so long
I wonder if she knows that she is makin' love so strong (So strong), I wonder what ground's below her, I wonder what sky's above
I wonder if she knows how much I extra absolutely, so complete and sweetly love her
I wonder if she knows how much I love her, I wonder, All the other girls I know are dumb, dumber than a post
But my girl knows everything (everything), I'm the king so I need 2 boast
Still I wonder if she'll really ever know (I wonder if she knows), CHORUS {x2)"

Sure you know he got plenty lyrics, yeah, up his sleeve
And after he got what he want, he just go up and leave, And Sunday chocolate on the roof right after his game
He like the Lakers but the Sixers on when he came
If he's with another now, you best believe the party's crackin'
You're getting played girl, you better get your mack on, And do onto others, as they do onto you

Waiting on that fool, to purchase what you'd been dying for?
And before Eye see you drop a spill, Eye have to bring you down
Now you got that chocolate barracuda hangin' round, Hangin' round your neck like a cheap gold chain
He don't deserve to say, that he ever knew your name
Much less he get to smell, the perfume Eye gave you
Please, don't tell me that you all got down, Better do onto others as they do onto you

Through a door that's deep in your soul
Through every pore of your body it goes
And in a light too bright to behold
Is a truth more shiny than gold
And as sure as this candle burns
Every soul must return, Into the light, into the light, From out of the light there comes a story...
Open your mind, and feel the glory
What's the hurry to die without trying?
If you could sell your worries (sell your worries)
Would anyone buy 'em? (oh no)
And for every flower that grows, even a baby knows

Bleed me till I'm broke., Sugar, Hell if I know why I let u drive my car
Don't I know that walking won't get me very far?
Sure I know that crying over u is just in vain
But all things I lose don't add up to all the things I gain, Irresistible bitch
I love the way u walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way u talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way u kiss
Ain't it a shame? (Irresistible)
Oh mama, mama, I wish I could re-
Hurt me!, Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
Stealing all my honey, baby, keep u by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke, Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody dance

Gimme the bass, gimme the bass, one time, Said the table to the chair
""You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chilblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!""
Said the table to the chair
(Can't nobody), Said the chair to the table
""Now you know we are not able!
(Fuck with us)
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk!""
(Can't nobody)
Said the table with a sigh
""It can do no harm to try
(Fuck with us)
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two?""
(Say, can't nobody), So they both went slowly down
(Fuck with us)
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound
(Can't nobody)
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side
(Fuck with us)
""See the table and the chair
Have come to take the air!""
(Y'all say it y'all), But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
Till, to see them safely back
They paid a ducky quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house, When they whispered to each other
""O delightful little brother!
(Can't nobody fuck with us)
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon!""
So the ducky and the little Browny
(Say it, y'all)
Mousey and the Beetle Dined,
And danced upon the heads
Till they toddled to their beds
(Can't nobody fuck with us)
Good God
Good God
Good God, Revolution, baby way down low

"It's Gonna Be Lonely Lyrics","2006","Prince","Its-Gonna-Be-Lonely-Lyrics","We've been together for quite some time
I'd think by now you'd know
It would take forever to get you off my mind
If ever you decide to go, I guess I got a little insecurity
When it's concerning you
I guess I'm just afraid that if you ever leave
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue, And I'd be so lonely without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me
Every little single thing that I need, lonely, Whatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on
'Til I go right out of my mind
And who could ever resist your accent from gay Paree
It gets me every time, I betcha thatcha never knew
That in my dreams you are the star
The only bummer is that you always want to leave
Who do you think you are?, Don't you know it's gonna be lonely?
Without you loving me I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me
Every little single thing that I need, lonely
It's gonna be lonely, Without you loving me
Giving me everything that I need
Oh pretty baby, can't you see?
It's gonna be lonely
Without you loving me
I know, I know it's gonna be lonely, Oh, whatever's in your kiss
I never could resist, oh, baby don't go
We've been together for quite some time
It'd take forever to get you off my mind, oh girl, Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you by my side
Don't you know that I could die, baby?
Without you loving me
Can't you see, it's gonna be lonely?, It's gonna be lonely, baby
So lonely, baby"

"Joy In Repetition Lyrics","2006","Prince","Joy-In-Repetition-Lyrics","{crowd noise same as for ""Alphabet Street""}, He like to frequent this club down up on 36th
Pimps and thangs like 2 hang outside and cuss for kicks, Talking 2 no one in particular, they say ""the baddest I am tonight""
4 letter words are seldom heard with such dignity and bite.
All the poets and the part time singers always hang inside
live music from a band plays a song called ""Soul Psychodelicide"".
The song's a year long and had been playing 4 months when he
walked into the place.
No one seemed to care, an introverted this-is-it look on most of their faces.
Up on the mic repeating 2 words, over and over again
was this woman he had never noticed before he lost himself in the
articulated manner in which she said them.
These 2 words, a little bit behind the beat.
I mean just enough 2 turn u on.
4 everytime she said the words another one of his doubts were gone., Should he try 2 rap with her? Should he stand and stare?
No one else was watching her, she didn't seem 2 care.
So over and over, she said the words til he could take no more, (no more)
he dragged her from the stage and together they ran through the back door
In the alley over by the curb he said tell me what's your name
she only said the words again and it started to rain (rain, rain, rain)
2 words falling between the drops and the moans of his condition
holding someone is truly believing there's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition.
She said love me, love me, what she say?
she say love me, love me.
Joy, why don't u love me baby, joy, why can't u love me baby
joy, come on and love me baby, joy in repetition
Alright, joy in repetition,
Alright, joy in repetition,
Alright, joy in repetition,
Alright, joy, all my wishes add up to one
Love me, joy, Love me, joy, Love me, joy
Love me, Love me, joy, joy, joy in repetition
joy, joy in repetition,
joy, joy (love me) in repetition,
Love me, love, joy, joy, joy in repetition
joy, and I'm gonna say it again, joy, joy, and I'm gonna say it again,
joy, I'd like 2 go way up high and say, Love me, joy
I'll say Love me, joy
Joy, joy in repetition, joy in repetition
There's joy in repetition"

This is for the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland, This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore

This is for the women, so beautifully complex
This one's for love without sex, This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow

Wanna see the mountains where the waters flow
Life back home depresses me, just another form of slavery
The cost of freedom is anything but free, I don't care if they are covered with snow
I don't care if the road is narrow, if it is I'll know
It was always meant to be, still in love I must believe
Whatever path I choose will lead me home
Lead me home, Lavaux, Take me to the streets of Portugal
That might be my destiny to see the waterfall
Tears or rain, they're all the same
The only way to win this game
To let everybody play and share the ball, There ain't nobody got no chains on me
I'm flying higher than any mountain, deeper than any sea
A paradox is box's key, I'm the why in mystery
You're gonna unlock the secrets if you please, Come take me to an assembly in New York
To speak of the brand new everlasting wonder war
To win or lose is so absurd
And the only casualty is the word, the word, Revolution time has come today
'Cause it took a black face to see the same decay
Like the chocolate of Vavey, in the sun they'll melt away
As for me, I'll laugh and go to the mountains where the waters flow
Back to the vineyards of Lavaux, Lavaux

"Let's Go Crazy Lyrics","2006","Prince","Lets-Go-Crazy-Lyrics","Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called LIFE.
Electric word ""life""
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you, there's something else
The afterworld.
A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night.
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life, you're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor, If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends
I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She just picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Aah, aah!"" is all I heard, I'm not gonna let de-elevator bring us down, oh no, let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go, All excited, but don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause, we're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what's it all for)
Better live now
Before the grim reaper comes knocking on your door
Tell me baby,
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go, Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go, Come on baby, let's get nuts!
Yeah, crazy, Let's go crazy, Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go, Go Crazy
I said, let's go (crazy), Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children, He's coming
He's coming
Coming, 
Take me away"

Let's have a baby
What are we livin' 4? Tell me
Let's make love, let's make love
So long have I gazed into your eyes
Wonderin' what they'd look like on a newborn child
I cannot lie when my hand is on your thighs
I'm thinking, isn't it a miracle that life comes from inside?
So long I have listened 2 your voice
Wonderin' what it would sound like coming from a girl or a boy
Isn't it funny that when U're truly in love
How just the thought of such things can bring U so much joy?
And I can't wait no more, oh no
Let's have a baby
Oh girl, come and shut the door, go on, shut it
Let's make love
U wanna make love?

I'll do what U want 2 do
But U got 2 understand
U're my woman and I'm your man
I can't even go 4 a ride
Believe me, honey, I've tried
Without thinking about a little baby
A baby sittin' right by my side
And if anybody in the whole wide world
Ever thought that they could do that 4 me
They are one mistaken girl
Cuz baby, U got me, U got me open, yes U do
And we're doing just fine
If U really love me, baby
If U can find the time

Don't it make you wanna holler?
Come with the life of the party, y'all
We're still makin' dollars, 25 years to life
The judge sentenced me to hard labor with a knife
Makin' cuts for y'all
Keepin' the party packed and wall to wall

""He don't play the hits no more
Plus I thought he was gay"", But it ain't nothin' if it ain't fun
My voice is gettin' higher
And I ain't never had my nose done
That's the other guy

Lookin' like a mack all up in here (lookin' like a mack all up in here)

And I rolled up in the town early afternoon
On the block lookin' hot like it's early June
At the top shinin' bright something like the moon
Can you picture with my lyrics bumpin' my cartoons
With my ace cause we're queens so we never get carded
Kill the scene then we leave call it ""dearly departed""

Not another autograph, cue the DJ
Everybody dance when I say
Whole block crushing and the girls are hot
Dancin' with each other cause the boys are not
Tryin' to trade numbers for the drinks they bought
But, whatcha supposed to think in a club full of thots
Pro black fashion and the girls are hot
Pick one, come and show me what you got
Everything or nothing if you wanna a lot of what's cookin'

Here's my crew dressed in all black like we mobbin'
Pockets got the mumps so you know we never starvin'
Noddin' and bobbin' our heads to the beat
You see how we rockin' shows, go and get up out your seats
Life is like a movie when we step upon the stage
I got fifty different styles that I got up on display
We gon' make the party jump so you know we're here to stay
Stackin' paper up while y'all on the same page, come on

The best that I ever had, Like the lion of judah, Driving away with a smile on my face
Wind blowing through my hair
Wondering how U'll feel when U find out
How much I really care (I care), Hoping that the tears roll down U'r face (Down U'r face)

"Look At Me Lyrics","2016","Prince","Look-At-Me-Lyrics","Look at me
Tell me what you see
The back and forth of an earthquake
Goes strong and sturdy tree
I ask myself this question, but it's still a mystery
How I'm gonna keep my balance when I
Look at you, How can you not know
Standing over there like a Nefertiti, or the queen, Dido
Please don't think too ill of me
It's all that I can do
Not to feel myself when I
Look at you, Modesty aside, whoever made you should be praised. Yes!
Ain't no need to hide
Every glass should be raised
Brandy or martini
Kudos overdue
What else is there really when I
Look at you?, Fight it, yes, my soul has tried
When you look at me
All other women just roll their eyes
But even Ray Charles can see you
Stevie Wonder can too
Thoughts well up and wonder
Thinking about me and you
A dozen fantasies you
Call me won and done
When you look at me
Look at you, look at me"

Macy and Common were there
Besides U know it takes awhile 4 me 2 do my hair, Come on get lost in the mellow mellow {x2}, How's that feel?, Where U wanna eat 2night, baby?
I know this dope spot called ""One Another""
Or maybe we might swing by ""The Egg""
The perfect place 2 play house - I could smother U
Or I just might be runnin' lines
There's just so much U can find
In the mellow of my mind, (Come on get lost in the mellow mellow, baby)
Come on get lost in the mellow mellow
This rainbow psychedelia
Come on (Come on get lost in the mellow mellow )
There ain't nothin' 2 be afraid of in the mellow mellow
Just U and me groovin' in the mellow (mellow mellow) of my mind
Now break it down, I wanna get lost in the composition of U
Learn the rhythm and play the only note U want me 2
I'm a good learner and once I understand
I'll stand under U and let U show me what U want your man 2 be
I could dance 4 U - a little comical minuet
If U desire I'll shed my attire - anything 2 get U wet, Shower, my flower?
So much 2 do, so little time
Choose wisely and U can find thee
In the mellow of my mind, Come on get lost in the mellow mellow {x2}, Can I sing 2 U while U bring yourself 2 joy?
I'll go slow at first, while U quench your thirst
Wet circles around the toy
While U bring yourself 2 joy"

He never had respect 4 money it's true
That's why he never wins
That's why he never ever has enough

He just pushes her away in a huff
And says 'Money don't matter 2 night', Money don't matter 2 night
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when u find out that u're better off

Cuz money didn't matter yesterday,

So he goes off and tries to find a partner
But all he finds are users (users)
All he finds are snakes in ever color

Maybe he wants affection instead of a plastic life
Maybe he doesn't know what he wants at all, He says please send all your moonbeam levels 2 me
Please send all your moonbeam levels 2 me
Please send all your moonbeam levels 2 me
I'm lookin' 4 a better place 2 die, A newborn child knows nothing of destruction
Nothing of love and hate
What happens in between is a mystery
Because we don't give a damn about his fate, He said he'll never keep diaries 2 learn from his mistakes
Instead he'll just repeat all the good things that he's done
Fight 4 perfect love until it's perfect love he makes
When he's happy then his battle will be won

And love will always leave u lonely, But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if u just believe (oh yeah)

There's nothing greater, u and me, Once upon a time in a haystack of despair,

Make believe it's a better world, a better life, Nothing on TV I ain't seen before
Another murder on the news, I can't take no more
Evil Incorporated, blowing up bombs and thangs
I have a child, huh, I have a lot 2 explain
I could write a letter, but who would I send it 2?
It was Sunday night, instead of doing what I usually do I., CHORUS, I called an old friend of mine just the other day
No congratulations, no respect paid
All she did was wonder if the rumors were true
I said - ""No, I ain't dead yet, but uh. what about U?""
I can count my friends with a peace sign: 1, 2
It was Sunday night, instead of doing what I usually do I., I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Somebody 2 talk 2, funny and bright (Oh)
I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life (A better life), I got no mail, my computer, I told them I don't wanna see a doctor unless he's lonely 2
Every Sunday night, instead of doing what I usually do I., I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Somebody 2 talk 2, funny and bright

Make believe it's a better world (Make believe it's a better world)
A better life {x52}, ""Goodbye"" {AOL sample}"

Say fellas
U ever have one them girls that just... bad?
Know what I mean?
Nah, I ain't talkin' about fine, I'm talkin' about bad
Cuss all the time, steal... man she rob her own moms
Down at the post office got 2 pictures
I'm talkin' about one of Bebe's kids, y'all - bad!
Hear me?
Oh, she fine 2...fine, Don't know why, I want that girl {x2}, 'Twas the middle of the summer
Rather late in the day
This pretty thang, she walked up 2 me
She said she was good 2 play
She told me 2 close my eyes
So she could get a kiss
I said, ""Sure, honey"" and obliged (Sure, honey)
Girl snatched my medallion and called me a bitch, running!, Don't know why, I want that girl {x4}, I found out her place of employment
Dry cleaning - ""We do fine"" (Ha ha ha ha ha...)
2 manifest a little unenjoyment in her life
Was all that was running through the middle of my mind
There are many elements: wind, fire, water
But none quite like the element of surprise
See my baby, she gave me that medallion
And it, uh, U know, it mean a lot 2 me
So, so I walked up in that piece with a disguise on
And I said, ""Hey!
I don't know what your name or your game is
But U better get your G-hind down on the floor
Cuz U see, I'm in a mood 2 do something koo-koo 2 U""
So she gave me that kiss and ran out the back door, ow!, Don't know why, I want that girl
Don't know why, but I want that girl
Don't know why, I want that girl
Don't know why, but I want that girl, Oh, turning around the corner
Thought that she would get by, huh - much 2 her surprise
Michael Yardbird dropped both his crutches downstairs
Tripped baby on her backside
Holdin' on the banister, sliding down slow
U know he about 2 fall down all them stairs, yo
My medallion's on the center line
She dropped my piece in the middle of the street
The taxi cab about 2 run it down (Beep beep, oh yeah)
But when the bling-bling caught the driver's eyes
He slammed on his brakes and jumped out his ride
And as he was just about 2 put his fat neck up in my jewels
(Uhn uhn uhn, nigga!)
Yardbird bounced down the stairs of that house
Crushing the bad girl like the Union Army crushed the Deep South
And when the driver turned his head 2 get his peek on
I entered at my medallion and broke the other way
Sister was limpin' but she was kinda good 2 play, Don't know why I want that girl {x4}
(Don't, man)

I'm on a roll - yo P, it's time 4 the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air, this is a motherfuckin' party

You need some ol' skool company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove
And a old school melody
When god his son and the love of family
Ruled in the community
The songs you sing
Lift you up to heaven
A heaven we can believe in, Everybody's talkin' about hard times
Like it just started yesterday
People eye know they've been strugglin'
At least it seems that way
Fat cats on wall street
They got a bailout
While somebody else got to wait
700 billion but myold neighborhood
Ain't nothing changed but the date, Every once in a while
You need some ol' skool company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove
And a old school melody
When god his son and the love of family
Ruled in the community
The songs you sing
Lift you up to heaven
A heaven we can believe in, Ain't nothing ever come from complaining
Xcept a bitter heart, that's true
Follow along and you gon wanna do
Something before the next chorus is thru
The songs we sing
They used to mean somethin
Now every other one is just mean
Rather than reminisce eye'm telling you this
It's time for a brand new scene, Every once in a while
You need some ol' skool company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove
And a old school melody
When god his son and the love of family
Ruled in the community

Lift you up to heaven
A heaven we can believe in, Everybody's sinkin' in the quicksand
Created by the keeper of time
Cast aside by using ancient tricks
That changes ur state of mind
They got you catering the whims of the flesh
before you get your paper right
Call me old fashioned
But back in the day
There wasn't no shorties in sight, 1st come job then come marriage b4 shorty
Come out with the baby carriage call me
Old fashioned just clap yo hands, just clap yo hands
Radio used to be local untouched by the man
Songs we used to sing used to mean something
Now they just bland like the drummer
Where's the real drummer? michael B
Mint condition, morris day
Jellybean wishin' Sheila e and brother John, sometimes me
'til dawn, If the white house is black

Cuz an old friend of mine got lost in the jive
Little did she know, when U're stuck in the snow
Nobody gets out alive, Tears fall gently in my garden
As I wait in vain 4 my sweet baby 2 call
I guess what my own brother told me was true
He had been with my sweet baby and she never really loved me at all, Night fell so dark this evenin'
The moon wasn't shinin' nowhere
Sometimes that old light in the alley would light up this old heart of mine
But now I'm wonderin' if there's someone up there who really cares, The night fell darkest in Persia
What used 2 flow blue is now flowin' black
Many a doctor can try, but only heaven knows why
When it comes 2 love
Why do some men, why do some men turn their backs?, Can't somebody please tell me?, Maybe the morning air will make me feel better
Oh, I hope better than I feel right now
Last night a stranger took my picture and then he, uh.
He asked if I'd buy it, huh
I said I guess I don't know how, Old, old friends 4 sale

No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control, Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control), Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books 4 the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat 4 some clothes and a rep
With her chin up, she scolded ""All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step""
And step she did 2 the straight A's
Then college, a master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work 4 free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are triflin'?
They just don't know
She said ""Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, U need Pussy Control'"", Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

'Bout how he gonna make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit

Cuz I met this girl named Pussy
At the club - International Balls (Pussy)
She was rollin' 4-deep
3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' a Hog
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down (Pussy)

And I'm astounded that U're here
I fear U're lonely and U want 2 know (Pussy)

Well I'm that nigga, at least I wanna be
But it's gonna be hard as hell (Pussy)
2 keep my mind off a body

Say what, huh?

All alone by the pier
Her husband was naughty
And caused his wife so many tears, He died without knowing forgiveness
And now she is sad, so sad
Maybe she'll come to the park
And forgive him
And life won't be so bad

First he crucified every dandelion out in the yard

And pushed the four-year-old down, onto the closet floor

Papa said ""Yeah, I know, that's what this here's 4""

He said ""How come I don't love my woman?""
Then he took aim and died

Artist - formerly known as Prince
You gotta get your peace on
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
And not to war, When the war upon people of color thru needles
Designed to disease instead of relieve
When it ceases
I'll be a man of peace
(Say what)
When this mask of vendetta
Like tears on the face of Coretta
Roll down and go away
I'll be happier
(Happier)
I'll be a man of peace, Everybody say!
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
(That's what we're here for)
And not to war, When the time that we spend
Watching TV depends on
Whether or not it destroy or transcend
Then I won't need
(I won't, I won't)
Won't need a warranty
When the power of the hour is not yours but is ours
And the faces we see reflect all that we be indeed
There'll be a jubilee, Everybody say
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
(That's what we're here for)
And not to war
Bass, (Talkin' about freedom)
The rewards that we share will be based on what's fair
And not the curliness or the thick of our hair
Real competition, if you dare!
Music is our middle name
And we don't wanna play your game
So when the mergers you make are with us
And you take a fair slice of the cake
That we bake then you break
That would be real cool
But y'all wanna act like fools!
(What's up with that?)
Can't we all just get along?
And have peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
And not to war
Peace
Peace
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
And not to war, In case some of y'all didn't hear it right
I didn't call him, his name wasn't the artist

"Peach Lyrics","2006","Prince","Peach-Lyrics","Uh-oh here she comes
She got them gold hot pants on again
Yeah man
I wanna talk, but I dunno
She's a peach, She was dark, she was tan
She made me glad to be a man
She was young, she was smart
Just one glance and she stole my heart
The kinda girl you wanna teach
She's a peach, Summertime, feelin' fine, getting wild
All that's on my mind
Here she come, dressed in red
Get her done is all that's in my head
Her hot pants can't hide her cheeks
She's a peach, She was pure, every ounce
I was sure, when her titties bounce
Every way, she's a winner
Turn a gay preacher to a sinner
No one you want your mama to meet
She's a peach, This is a girl plays hard to get, I would die if I kissed her
I would try but I'm last on her list
She's so cool and I'm so ugly
I'd be a fool to think that she could love me
This kinda girl's always out of reach
She's a peach"

would u come and visit me?
Just 2 slander my name hopin'

If I did would u remember
2 feed the dove and clean the cage?
And never count in front of the children
lest they die of old age, I don't really know y we have 2 go r separate ways
Whether or not we grow after the seeds r shown
Only time can say..., Can I offer u baklava?
or a bagel with cream cheese?
Will we say grace 2 r father
holding hands down on r knees?
R we better off just fighting?
U on ur side, me on mine
R the words that I keep writing...
only pearls b4 the swine?
What makes men claim that u're a friend
when u're not at all?
They knock u down and then,
they lift u up again, just 2 c u fall...
But like a bird I'll keep on singing...
a song that never leaves ur mind
If nothing else u've taught me one thing...
""Never cast ur pearls b4 the swine"""

Call your next of kin 'cuz your ass is gone

Still on the side, ah, Cuzzin' when Spooky say dead, you better say died
Or you can fly high right by Spooky
And all that he crawls for

Boys and motherfuckin' girls (""319, 319"" ""Cool"")
This is your captain with no name speakin'
And I'm here 2 rock your world
With a tale that will soon be classic
About a woman U already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control (Are U ready?), Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh, Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books 4 the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat 4 some clothes and a rep
With her chin up, she scolded ""All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step""
And step she did 2 the straight A's
Then college, a master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work 4 free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are triflin'?
They just don't know
She said ""Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, U need Pussy Control'"" (Are U ready?), Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh, Verse 2
Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good 'n' plenty of his own
In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick wanna stick her
Uh, talkin' more shit than a bit
'Bout how he gonna make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said ""Nigga, U crazy if U don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
U can go platinum 4 times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week
So push up on somebody that wanna hear that
Cuz this somebody here don't wanna know
Boy, U better act like U understand
When U roll with Pussy Control"" (Are U ready?), Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh, Breakdown
(Are U ready 4 the best Pussy U ever felt?) {x2}, With one more verse 2 the story
I need another piece of your ear
I wanna hip U all 2 the reason
I'm known as the Player of the Year
Cuz I met this girl named Pussy
At the club - International Balls
She was rollin' 4-deep
3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' a Hog
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said ""Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that U're here
I fear U're lonely and U want 2 know
A 12 o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that U're Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I wanna be
But it's gonna be hard as hell
2 keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want 2 sell, sell, sell (75, we need another. 85, 85 here, sold!)
Can I tell U what I'm thinkin' that U already know?
U need a motherfucker that respects your name""

He told me several times that he didn't like my kind

But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, Ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door, She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind U find in a second hand store

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her, Built like she was
She had the nerve 2 ask me
If I planned 2 do her any harm, So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm, I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed, She wasn't 2 bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how 2 get her kicks, She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind U find in a second hand store

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

I think I love her, The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who U are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
U feel like a movie star, Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance 2 do it all again, I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then, (Raspberry beret)

The kind U find (In a second hand store)
Oh no no

Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)

Eye was too busy, said eye was too busy

Looking at you, babe, Still it's nice to know that uh, when bodies wear out

Ain't nothing worse than an old worn out love song
Tell me do you like my hair this way?
Remember all the way back in the day
When we would compare who's afro was the roundest, Mirrored tiles above the bed
Fishing nets and posters all over the walls, oh yeah
Sometimes eye just wanna go sit out on the stool
And uh, play my guitar
Just watch all the, all the cars go by"

Is that nobody ever wins
The next generation grows up
And learns how to do it all over again, No matter who started the argument
Just matters how each one ends
How many people really want resolution, The main problem with people
Is they never do what they say
One minute they want peace
Then do everything to make it go away, Dropping bombs on each other
In the act of saving face
Tell me now people
How is that resolution, Either U do or U don't
Either U will or U won't
Making amends (Make amends)
A bitter pill to swallow, 
What can we lose if we try
With no water, a flower dies
With no 1 2 lead resolution will follow, Love is like a circle
No beginning and no end
A broken heart will mend
If U love it like your best friend, Handle your heart with care
It's as delicate as a whim
Winter storms come again
Break a resolution, Whether U will or U won't
Whether U do or U don't, Come on everybody all over the world
La-la-la-la
All over the world
Do-do-do-do

Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance, an army's marching feet (Hup 2 3 4 - Hup 2 3 4)
But behold... we will watch them fall, And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, 6 others will curse me
But that's alright (that's alright)
For I will watch them fall (1 2 3 4 5 6 7), All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all

One day all 7 will die, (Just how old?), And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their 7 tears, but do not fear
For in the distance, 12 souls from now
You and me will still be here...
We will still be here, There will be a new city with the streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old, and
There will be no death, for with every breath
A voice of many colors sings a song that's so... bold
Sing it while we watch them fall (fall...), All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect, and a savoir-faire
No one else in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and, you are mine and to-
-gether we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry...
One day all 7 will die, (Just how old)

In france a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called the disciples
High on crack, totin a machine gun, Time, time, Hurricane annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
U turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin u somebody died
Sister killed her baby cuz she could afford 2 feed it
And were sending people 2 the moon
In september my cousin tried reefer 4 the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's june, Times, times, Its silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants 2 fly
Some say a man aint happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh why
Time, time, Baby make a speech, star wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time, times, Its silly, no?
When a rocket blows
And everybody still wants 2 fly
Some say a man aint happy, truly
Until a man truly dies

That I'd wanna give 2
A diamond ring, anything, that U ask me 2
But there U are bragging 2 u're friend
Making up a story that's so lame
That I was down 2 be u're sugardaddy
A one way ticket 2 ghetto fame
Why do we play this silly game?, Every other night U weren't at home
Out in the streets just actin' grown
Never with a bodyguard or chaperone
Then I hear a rumor that breaks my heart
Instead of takin' care of yourself u're tearin' yourself apart
Now why U wanna (why u wanna), why U wanna
Now why U wanna go and do that love?
Why do we play this silly game?, I never thought U would be the 1

Incest is everything it's said to be

Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend, I was only 16 and only half a man
My sister didn't give a goddamn
She only wanted to turn me out
She [took a whip to] me until I shout

Near the ocean makin' the snow man
On his face we were makin' a smile
'cause just like a daddy
The snow man had style, CHORUS:

Another Christmas gone
I got a chess game this time
A bishop takes the pawn
Sometimes I wanna go back where
The ocean swallows the shore

When my snow man is no more, no more, Winter seldom passing
Where the memory doesn't sway
2 the smell of a Christmas dinner
Shared the family way (Shared in the family way)
Everything seems so perfect
That nothing would dare go wrong
But tears come with the summer

Will they ever make anyone smile

A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again,
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way..., Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
and all good things, they say, never last, Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried, Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last, I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again, Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last, All good things they say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past"

Yes, that's right, it's true
That don't make anybody
More or less as good as you, If you can't feel the music
That's all you really need
Then turn this party all the way out
Good time guaranteed, Everybody get up, clap your hands
Dancin' to the beat
Whatever you do little darlin'
It's cool just get up out your seat, Wave your flag
Because everybody plays a part
One world united
Singing the song of the heart, Song, the song of the heart
The song, the song of the heart, Look everybody makes mistakes
Oh yeah, not one or two
That don't make the dirty little things
They say about you true, You tell 'em, step aside little babies
And watch me do my thing
And I don't even need a good reason to do
Just listen to me sing, Everybody get up, clap your hands
And show them what you got
Tonight we gonna jam from now until eternity
Don't you stop, make it hot oh, Wave your flag
Because everybody plays a part
One world united
Singing this song, this song of the heart, The song, the song of the heart
The song, the song of the heart, Come on, watch me now, Oh, I don't care what the people say
This is my life
I just got to like that okay
They can go fly their momma's kite, We can be together if we all do a part
I'll let you if you let me sing the song of the heart
We can be together if we all do a part
I'll let you if you let me sing the song, Song of the heart, One world, one world, one world united

They said you up and ran away
All because of what somebody said
I spent my wedding night alone in bed, 'Cuz you left me standing at the altar
You left big tears in my eyes

You didn't even stop to ask me who
What or where or why, Ever since the day that we first met
Everybody been jealous as they could get

People sayin' this and sayin' that
(Sayin' that)
Struck us, struck us out before we even got to bat, Hey, you left me standing at the altar
You left big tears in my eyes

You didn't even stop to ask me who
What or where or why, How could you do this, how could you leave?
When you knew how much you meant to me
(You meant to me)
I gave to you more than I've given any friend
Just to have you give it all back in the end, You left my poor heart broken
You left my world in a daze
(In a daze)
If I could, I'd write a letter to you
But I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say, I got the news just yesterday
They said you up and ran away
If there's a God way up above
One day you'll have to answer to him for my love, You left me standing at the altar
You left big tears in my eyes
You didn't even stop to ask me who, what or where or why, You left my poor heart broken
You left my world in a daze

We changed up, we got a brand new beat
Now we got the summers poppin' in the street

Everybody jam cause this party's goin' ham
Just stare, can I help you?
Ain't nobody stoppin' cause we got this party poppin' now, Second things first, we know you got thirst
But we like it when you're fiening for the funk until it hurts
Jump, air, can you blame me?
Every time you whip it to the beat, it make a brother just stare
Sister freak me
Nobody got a chance
You need to back up, let me show you how to dance
Stare, can I get a kiss?, I pull out a tune
Curvy ma, tell me what you wanna do
Do you wanna

"Starfish And Coffee Lyrics","2006","Prince","Starfish-And-Coffee-Lyrics","It was 7: 45 we were all in line
2 greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us where ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20 and every single day
If U asked her what she had 4 breakfast
This is what she'd say
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam, Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different color socks
Sometimes I wondered if the mates where in her lunchbox
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died, U know what we found?, Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set your mind free, honey
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam, Starfish and coffee, Cynthia had a happy face, just like the one she'd draw
On every wall in every school
But it's all right, it's 4 a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia, keep singin', Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee

In another dream of you, all night long
Out of town, I had to go but now
I need a cup of somethin' black and strong, Beside me, I was just awaken up
With you here, now you're gone
Why oh why didn't you hurry along
With me this time? Right or wrong, As a matter of fact, I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you, babe
When we're together, everything is cool
Beautiful lover, friend, I'll never leave you again
You and me, we're sticky like glue, Bright blue eyes staring down into mine saying
""Good morning, how are you?""
I can't lie, wakin' up in a plane
Without a warning, ain't too cool, Cast ashore without a paddle
And no more excuses, we just drown
What's the score? If you still really wanna
Be my muse then come around, As a matter of fact I just can't live without you, babe
I'm wonderin' if you feel the same way too
I'm huggin' this pillow tight, the way we did last night
The sweat of each other, sticky like glue, Sticky, sticky, 1, 2
That was the coolest movie ever
The one we saw last night
The closer you got to me
The less we saw, alright, The scene you remember the most is none of 'em
That ain't a boast, girl
I'm just in front of them others, I'm a gracious host
Everybody under me, make a toast, As a matter of fact, I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you, babe

I got somethin' I wanna say to you, babe
You might wanna dig me later
I think you better dig me now
Listen, I can't get to sleep unless your body
Unless your body is right here next to me
It's crazy baby, I know we're dysfunctional, But I, I, I, I just can't, can't see myself
Myself with another, girl
Oh, what in the world is wrong with me?
I don't know what's wrong with me, babe, Tell me what to do, is it me or you?
We fight so much and then we're through
It might come as a shock to you
But I, I, I, I, I still love you, yes, I do, Sticky like glue, sticky, sticky
Don't you think I ain't when I am?
One more thing and then I'm out, You get us wet with your pride
Then you hang us both outside to cry, cry
What's that sound?
Said it must be raining, raining tears, tears, tears, But you need to dry your eyes
Please, please don't cry
'Cause we ain't, I ain't, going nowhere, no, Somebody needs to tell that girl

And time away from U has taught me
What I should've known
This hole I'm trying to fill with another
Yeah, it's grown and I got u're package
But when I tried to write U back I bailed
See trying 2 express the future sometimes language fails
And over this time, I've learned
My life force has increased by knowing U
Every door that closes another one opens
Strange but true, But no regrets because I 4get the unfamiliar faces
Those petty lies and alibies, just golddigger's chasin
Dreams of sovereignty, they tried 2 come between U and me
A curse therein set forth a chain of events
That only freed me when I remembered
Where I was and who I am
The only Prince that will ever rule this Holy Land, All understand and all stand under this affirmation now
By the power invested in me by God all negativity bows
Strange but true, let's see what U can do, U may have lost me... uh, but I found myself
The one's who love me without condition
This is my wealth and with these words, I will win
Repeat them over and over again, All understand and all stand under this affirmation now
By the power invested in me by God all negativity bows

The illusion of you training my soul

Making me whole, I wish there was a word to express the way I feel about you

You've got me where you want me
Can't you see?, Listen
I love you

There's no one else for me but you

Maybe it's cause she comes from East L.A.
But every time I see her body on display
I gotta call her name from the DJ booth
Strobe light flash and you know the truth

Keys to the crib with no dispute
See her dancing in her birthday suit - Supercute, Together we wonder how we got enslaved and why

Jericho falls when we all discern the lie
Yo, why the man wanna lie?
I look at her eyes go wild, she smiles - Supercute, CHORUS, On a dare I wanna see if she will share
The kinda toys she uses when I'm not there
None at all she swears
I don't care

I make her buy another one
And a new dress to wear
(vibrator noise)
Goes the toy against her curly hair
Now she must confess
How she really like to play
Or if she don't, I lower the speed
And bad words she'll say
Tell me how you play, how you play
Even in her anger she's still

She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde
Tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well...
Earlier I'd been talkin' stuff in a violent room
Fightin' with a lover's past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well...
I ordered
""Yeah, lemme get a fruit cocktail
I ain't 2 hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said ""sound like a real man 2 me
U're kinda cute
Do u wanna take a bath?""
Oh, I said ""cool, but I'm leaving my pants on cuz I'm kinda going with someone""
She said ""sound like a real man 2 me
Mind if I turn on the radio?
Oh, my favorite song!"" she said, and it was Joni singing ""Help me, I think I'm falling...""
Ring!
The phone rang and she said ""whoever's calling can't be as cute as u""
Right then and there I knew I was through
Dorothy Parker was cool, Well..., My pants were wet
They came off but she didn't see the movie cuz she hadn't read the book first
Instead, she pretended she was blind - an affliction brought on by the witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh
I felt much better so I went back to the violent room
Let me tell u what I did...
I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner

No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry, he is coming
Don't die without knowing the cross
Ghettos 2 the left of us
Flowers 2 the right
There'll be bread 4 all of us
If we can just bear the cross, Sweet song of salvation
A pregnant mother sings
She lives in starvation
Her children need all that she brings, We all have our problems
Some BIG, some are small
Soon all of our problems
Will be taken by the cross, Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry 4 he is coming
Don't die without knowing the cross, Ghettos 2 the left of us

I said let me tell U something by a guy that raps
Yo, why buy U if he can just lease U
Why iron you if he can just crease U
Why try you if he won't breed U
Why drive through if he won't eat U

If we drown then we'll be delivered

The other one trying 2 focus through all your tears
U can try and try but there's nothin' 2 hide
U can't run from yourself and what's inside
U got 2 find the answers 2 the questions that U most fear, So over and over U ask your soul
Why'd U come down 2 a world so cold?
And the voice inside says 2night the truth will be told, U surrounded yourself with all the wrong faces
Spending your time in all the wrong places
Puttin' your faith in things that only make U cry
People say they love U when they wanna help
But how can they when U can't help yourself?
The more they say they love U, the more U just wanna die
So here we go again, the self analysis
Have another glass of Port and uh. forget this
The band's playin' at the club 2night and they're bound 2 groove, There U are, U think U're high
U can't ask yourself cuz U'd only lie
If U had a dollar 4 every time U tried, U can't call nobody cuz they'll tell U straight up
Come and make love when U really hate 'em
Relationships based on the physical are over and done
They're over and done (They're over and done)

With only one, with only one
Only one... one (one), And then it hit 'cha like a fist on a wall

Keepin' U happy (happy) and proud 2 call His name (Go'n and say it)

Why'd U come down 2 a world so cold?

If we drown then we'll be delivered (Yes we will)
If we don't then we'll never see the light (No)
If U die before U try
U'll have 2 come back and face the light (Oh yes)
When U believe it, U got a good reason 2 cry (Oh my, my), So I went on down 2 the holy river
I called my girl and told her I had something 2 give her
I asked her 2 marry me and she said yes, I cried
Oh, that night I drowned in her tears and mine
And. and instead of a glass of sorrow and wine
Looking back y'all, I don't miss nothing except the time
And when I see that picture upon the wall
The one eye staring at nothing at all
My eyes trying 2 focus but these are much different tears

"The Love We Make Lyrics","2006","Prince","The-Love-We-Make-Lyrics","Desperate is the day that is tomorrow
For those who do not know the time has come
To whip the dogs that beg, steal or borrow
From the table, God set for His son, Wicked is the witch that stands for nothing
All the while watching to see you fall
Deeper than the ditch that bred your suffering
The one being dug right now by them all, Happy is the way to meet your burdens
No matter how heavy or dark the day
Pity on those with no hope for tomorrow
It's never as bad as it seems until we say, Precious is the baby with a mother
That tells him that his Saviour is coming soon
All that believe will cleanse and purify themselves
Put down the needle, put down the spoon, Precious is the baby with a mother
That tells him that his Saviour is coming soon
All that believe will cleanse and purify themselves
Put down the needle, put down the spoon, Sacred is the prayer that asks for nothing, oh
While seeking to give thanks for every breath we take, oh
Blessed are we inside this prayer
For in the new world, we will be there, The only love there is, is the love we make
The only love there is, is the love we make
(The only love there is, is the love we make)
Only love there is, only love there is
The only love there is, is the love we make

The only love there is, is the love we make"

Your never goin to see her again-never
Now shes gonna need a shoulder to cry on
Shes gonna need a friend
Shes gonna need a pillowcase-something to put those tears on
And I've got some purple satin lacies
1 seond later than the second your gone, Shes gonna miss you at first
But then shes gonna buy me things
Thats when Im gonna lay her
'Cross my piano stool and sing to her, Chorus
Honey I tried to tell him
That you were the marrying kind
A faithful one man woman
The best he would ever find
I guess he wasnt trying to hear that
So there aint nothing left to say
I tried to tell him if you run to me
I wont run away, If you leave her now
You'll never get another glimpse
Im goin to lace her with enough ice to recap the poles
There might be another solar eclipse
Shes gonna find...
bath water hot enough to be touched(oh man, porkchop is hurtin)
Im gonna put her on the same diet Missy went on
You know she eat too much
Tonight, shes gonna miss you at first
But then she'll get used to me
All of the tricks I would try
To make her take this ring and make love to me, Chorus, Run away
Dont run away"

Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fanstasy she was
That's why he had 2 wait
If he poured his heart into a glass
And offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers
They could take a walk down the oceanside
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel
And ride or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe
Or just one star
Or just how far was the walk 4 the morning papers, Let me play it for u one time, oh oh
Well
Hey
Shucks, Why is age more than a number when it comes 2 love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?, Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?, Somebody help me sing it now, La-la-la-la-la-la

And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more

That it wouldn't last

Love 'em and leave 'em fast
Guess I must be dumb, she had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And U say - ""What have I got 2 lose?""

We sacrifice

Cord wrapped around my neck
Epileptic 'til the age of seven
I was sure Heaven marked the deck

When the smoke was cleared their high was gone, Education got important so important to Victor
A little more important than ripple and weed

"The Same December Lyrics","2006","Prince","The-Same-December-Lyrics","Once was this ball with a line straight down the middle
One side was black and the other one white
And they both understood so little
That they spent their whole lives tryin' 2 tell each other what time it was
When all along it did not matter what either said because, because, CHORUS:
U only know what U know
U only see what your heart will show
U only love when your soul remembers
We all come from the same December
And in the end, that's where we'll go
So let's go!, Ooh yeah, oh yeah, There once was a golden idol that went 2 the winners
Needless 2 say it didn't make 'em feel any less a sinner
Cuz the very next mornin' the whole damn world was the same
Yes it was
The idol still shinin', but the voice inside it said
""There ain't no winners in this game"", CHORUS, Hey!
There once was an angel who most certainly watched over me
But if it got me through the day, is it crazy?, Yeah, I'll be crazy
Until the demons fall as far as anyone can fall
When they reap what they done sowed, I'll be standin' tall
We spend our whole lives tryin' 2 dog the other man
When what we need 2 do is try 2 give him all we can
But uh. U only know what U know
And uh. U only see what your heart'll show
And uh. U only love when your soul remembers
We all come from the same December
And in the end, that's where we'll go

Velvet splash, only you and I can under
Only you can understand, The sunlight draws a picture through the silky lace
That hangs above your, hangs above your door
A picture that is waving that is seems to be
With every thrust you make me beg for more, A robin sings a masterpiece
That lives and dies unheard
For screams of passion, A sound produced by two in love

Curtains dance and autumn plays on

I'd rather die here in your screams of passion

Excuse me but is that your passion?
Do you want my passion? Do you want my passion?
If you want my love, if you want my body, baby, Let me hear you, let me hear you

Bouncin on the Summer Spring and when U start 2 Fall
U'll come like a cold Winter do in Montreal
Come on baby, under the sun and moon and stars

I couldn't really truly
Because my only friend is you, Ooh ooh ooh ooohh

Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart

"U Know Lyrics","2014","Prince","U-Know-Lyrics","Put your hands together
No, like this
Surprise, suprise
Another treat, another trick
This is sweet
Which one's which, For the record, let me state
That I never had a reason to
Break contractually or sever
Relationship with anyone I pleasure, For the playa, let me stop and say-a
That I only paid attention when
When I heard you mention that
He tried to take your treasure
Oh no he didn't, And as a matter of fact
I would have gave you back
But then he had a heart attack
When you made him pack
And said his shack without you would be better, See, what I really mean, See, what I really mean
Is that our future queen
Should never be in frustulation
With this rock and roll machine
Oh no not ever, Yeah, you know
What, You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know, You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know, If you really wanna find the answer
To this Cancer, then we must rewind
Then nevermind the first opinion
You better act surprised, To run this game requires fame
You stole a name and nothing gained
Unless you sacrifice my dear
It's only claim for his dominion, And any question of the deal
Is met with another demand to kneel
And reprimand concealed allegations of you sinning, That's why
Feminine wiles are not surprised
In recognizing that the power of the breasts
Is just a test that you'll be winning, You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know, You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know, You know how much I want you

Stop lettin' him tell me what it takes to be a woman
Gotta never stop believing in me, myself, and I
Pretty little lies that the rich keep using
I opened up my eyes,
The only reason they're winning is 'cause I keep losing
Gotta get back to my right place
This is the subject of my show
We love the human race
This is where I belong, Chorus, Wonderfully, truly, caring you make the words I wish in every song.
Come here now pretty baby let me take you somewhere and put you real close
We've both been in the dark much too long
Now that we got the knowledge and the truth we can both be strong

Maybe I'll die young like heroes die
Maybe I'll kiss u some wild special way
If nobody kills me or thrills me soon,

If I, uh, just give her a little ear?

"Walk In The Sand Lyrics","2010","Prince","Walk-In-The-Sand-Lyrics","After a long journey, the final mile
Wish that we walk together all the while
After a mild labor, we both smile
All of the battles that we lost, both of us in denial, 'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you, Another sun is rising
To bed with no delay
The both of us go despising
Not enough time to play, Memories come and then they go
Somewhere far away
Why can't we just get lost together
And spend each and every day doing it?, Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you, Walk in sand, We have danced with royalty
And pimps of the like
You can't please everybody
But such is a life, If there was only one thing
In this world that were true
Nothing's better in this world
Than to walk in sand with you, Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you, Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you, Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you"
"Wall of Berlin Lyrics","2016","Prince","Wall-of-Berlin-Lyrics","Where am eye?
In a universe of paradoxical design
Reality o merely in the mind
In my head or in some german town
She said ""u want a 4 leaf clover
In the round?""
Ain't superstitious
And eye don't believe in luck
But eye heard the thunder
B4 the lightning struck
Couldn't read the writing
Cuz it was so small
But according 2 the document she got on the wall, She gets down like the wall of berlin
Eye come round about a quarter 2 ten
We just met or at least we pretend
It's so fresh knockin' down
The wall of berlin, Where am eye?
A galaxy of monumental delight
Or parallel hologram copyright
The call comes unexpected
Like a mugger in a park
And the sound of the train interrupts the?, Is that the queen of sheba
Or an alien dream?
The marks on the table say
Somewhere in between
Not one 4 rituals
But one thing eye have found
Everything's better when you come around, She gets down like the wall of berlin
Eye come round about a quarter 2 ten
We just met or at least we pretend
It's so fresh knockin' down
The wall of berlin"

The minute, the moment that I first laid eyes on you
I guess I knew that sooner or later this power
Would manifest itself into a rendezvous
Small dark room that's where I let you, smother
In front of your gut, toned other, why should I care?
Cheap perfume all over those burgundy stockings
The ones I tied you, up with I shoulda just left 'em there
(Shoulda just left 'em there)
Why'd I waste my kisses on you?

That requires your attention
Is something that has veered
from its path
And preordained destiny
of total enlightenment, I never wanted a typical life
scripted role, huh... trophy wife
All I ever wanted, to b left alone
See my beds made up at night
Cuz in my dreams I roam
Just trying to find, trying to find
My way back, back home, So many reasons why
There's so many reasons why
I don't belong here
But now that I am I
Without fear I am
Gonna conquer with no fear
Until I find my way back home
Until I find my way back home
Find my way back home, Most people in this world are born dead
But I was born alive
I was born with this dream
With a dream outside my head
That I could find my way back home
My my way way back home, Is this the way?, Power to the ones, power to the ones
who could raise a child like me
The path was set
But if u look the truth will set us free
I've heard about those happy endings
But it's still a mystery
Lemme tell u about me
I'm happiest when I can see
My way back home
Can u see my way back home
Can u see my way back home"

When the voices you hear commands you
To entertain the absurd
When you do, the action unlocks
The apocalypse of that you've heard of
When the day lies before you
Seems the dakness in a word
Welcome, welcome to the dawn, Every piece is a puzzle and every name a clue
Every charge you make is karma
So be careful what you do

See, on the quantum tip I flipped on the notion
When the Adam split, we got Eve
Duality's now a groupie with a backstage pass, And they ain't gonna leave till they get some

Singed by the candle underneath the archway
Wherever they land, they'll have to stay
Who can say, but what a price to pay, Whitecaps on the water
But that's okay
Ain't never been a storm I'm runnin' from
Come my way
Weather man said it would be easy
Over in a day
It's windy now, but it's gonna be okay, For the life of me, I just can't recall
It's still a mystery, that's
'Cause dark gallows lead to brighter halls
And masquerade, masquerade, Whitecaps on the water

"You Lyrics","2007","Prince","You-Lyrics","Me,
It was always all about me
My job, my plans, my time
That's all I cared about
Myself, I only need myself
To get me through my life
But suddenly I found... That..., Chorus:, I want, I need
I crave, I breath
I feel, I hope
I dream, I know
I trust, I love
You, Life,
I'm just discovering life
How magical it is
Because of all you are
These days,
I wake up and I'm amazed
How much I want to give
Since you touched my heart, Repeat chorus, Bridge:
It wasn't luck
It wasn't fate(No it wasn't fate)
There's just one reason my world's
changed
(One reason my world's changed,
it was you), Repeat chorus"
"You Will Be Moved Lyrics","2006","Prince","You-Will-Be-Moved-Lyrics","You will be moved
When the baby lets out his very first cry
You will be moved
When you think of how hard he'll have to try, He'll grow up on an empty stomach
But he'll try his best to listen
To the teacher readin' from a school book
With half the pages missin', Surely when the rain comes, you will be moved
La da da da da, see the video, You will be moved
And you will be when the baby makes all the grades
You will be moved
And you will be when they still don't hire him anyway, Moved by a system
Without one single guarantee
That an education is the answer
And love will set us free, Surely when the rain comes, you will be moved
La da da da da, see the video, Oh, you will be moved when the rain comes
Oh yes, you will be moved
When the streets overflow with angry souls
That's when you see the truth, When the pain that you've inflicted
Comes back on your door for roost
(Back on your door for roost)
That's when you'll see the future
(Future)
But you won't see you, Surely when the rain comes, you will be moved
La da da da da, see the video, You will be moved
When the whip comes down on the back of one of your own
You will be moved
When you look for compassion but you find you're all alone, Moved and you will be when you are
That's when you'll know
That the bread you share is better
Than the blood that your deeds have caused for flow
(That the bread is better than the blood), Surely when the rain comes, you will be moved
La da da da da, see the video, Hey, you will be moved when the rain comes
Oh yes, you will be moved
When the streets all flow with angry souls
That's when you'll see the truth, When the pain that you've inflicted
Comes back on your door for roost

That's when you'll see the future

But you won't see you, I said surely when the rain comes, you will be moved

"Young and Beautiful Lyrics","2007","Prince","Young-and-Beautiful-Lyrics","I've seen it all
Done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
And Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child, Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?, I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock 'n' roll
The way you play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul, Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?, Dear lord, when I get to heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes tell me that you'll let him in
Father tell me if you can
Oh that grace, oh that body
Oh that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds, Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

"Your Way Lyrics","2007","Prince","Your-Way-Lyrics","Every time I try to take a breath so deep
I only fall back to my life
Feeling like the black sheep
But this time I wanna dive, Rising every morning, sinking every night
Notice, there is more to love
So I`ve to walk into the light
To recognize the Lord above, Coordination every move, you see
I don`t need a lot of fame
Because he knows me
Because he knows my name, So showing my real face
Makes me dive into the ocean
Of life with a whole new space
A whole new me with every step and every motion, So scream it or roar
Because you are gay
So why shut the door
He knows, he made you this way"

"All Along The Watchtower Lyrics","2010","Jimi-Hendrix","All-Along-The-Watchtower-Lyrics","""There must be some kind of way out of here,""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth."", ""No reason to get excited,""
The thief, he kindly spoke.
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late."", All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl, All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower"
"Black Gold Lyrics","2006","Jimi-Hendrix","Black-Gold-Lyrics","Black is gold is pure
And true kings of this earth., 1., So I say it's up to us to straighten
Out this mess...
We got to go through hell...
And then that's the last of this
Miserable test..., 2., Black must be bold
Because it's gold and true
Kings of this world...
So let them go to the moon.
Yes let them go to mars.
Because deep down inside
They're really from the stars., 3., That's why they don't want
Us to mix...just the way
The word of God had said.
So let them go to saturn...that's
Where they'll learn instead.
Because black and white
Together is right...
And white by itself is
An egotistic elf., 4., So they show you how to
Kill...and if you don't
They will.
What do they know about
Happiness...
How can they about life...
They just got lost in space.
So when they landed,
Atlantis cried., So if they're so alone try
To make them feel at home.
So let them fetch you fire wood.
And let them nibble on the bone.
So invent a word called love.
And then they blame our mistakes on god.
Don't you know how lonely they must be.
So many light years from home.
Hey soulful people I'm calling.
Don't be no more slaves.
Because God will protect us
When it comes to doomsday.
Realize before it's too late...
That no one on earth will escape.
We are the kings of earth.
And axis gonna put them slaves...
They killed so many worlds before.
But they will pass sentence upon themselves...
When the earth opens up...will
They be saved from our hell., I feel the truth of life.
We better all realize...
People like me and you
We feel so bad, don't know
What to do... they keep us
High low on drugs.
And they got us making their rugs...
As we go dripping blood.
But the sun knows as
The wind blows and the
Fire grows towards the
Far shores and the water
Foams to make steamed
Bones of all of those who don't belive that...
Black is gold is the kings of this world.
We all better get our places
Before God tells us to our
Face we are...past the human race.
Let's pray that we all agree
We got to straighten out the family tree.
Life is for you and me togather.
That's the way it was meant to be.
White man watch your mouth
Because our drums, they face the south.
And you can't kill the god
That kept you alive between
The poles of the north and south.
You better adjust your place
In this world...before your
Hair, it starts to curl...and the
Yellow, red, and black of this
World will tear your ass and soul apart., Where is he coming from ?
From heaven where 1,000,000
Worlds are one.
Where is he going to ?
He's going to make contact
With the living and the dead...
Here comes black gold...
Gather round young and old...
He's going to be felt by the
Timid and the bold...
Within a wink of an eye,, With the wink of an eye
Egos swell, bust and die...
Kingdoms fall and cry...
With the wink of an eye...
With the wink of an eye
A new born baby cries...
And a 100 soldiers die with
The wink of an eye."

Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all kiddin' you, You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud, now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal, How does it feel, how does it feel
To be on your own with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone, You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
Don't you know you only used to get juiced in it?
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
Now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it, You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say,""Do you want to make a deal?"", How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone, You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all came down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You should never let other people get your kicks for you, You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at?
After he's taken everything he could steal, How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone, Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts and things
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe, You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, and you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal, How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone"

and the CLOWNS HAVE ALL gone to bed
you can hear happiness STAGGERING on down the street
footprints dressed in red
and the wind whispers Mary, A broom is drearly sweeping
of the broken pieces of yesterdays life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
somewhere a king has no wife
and the wind it cries Mary, THE TRAFFIC lights they a turn blue tomorrow
and shine the emptiness down on my bed
the tiny island sags down the street
cause the life that lives is dead
and the wind screams Mary., Will the wind every remember
the names it has blown in the past
and with this crush its old age and its wisdom
it whisper no this will be the last
and the wind cries Mary."

From my heart so you'll clearly hear...
There are people so dear...
They're like children...
Naked in a cold world...
Beautiful children
In an old world..., May I take you away
From the evils of today
To the dreams of tomorrow.
You know that heaven...
Has no sorrow.
You know that heaven...
Has no tomorrow., Hear the sound of the magic drums...
Hearts are beating for the sun...
Sending evil on the run...
Now watch the wind..., Look over yonder...
Here comes some news...
Coming down like lightning...
Straight for me and you.
People of destruction
Your time is out of date...
People who's living crooked,
Better start getting straight., I've been through some changes,
A whole lot of re-arranges...
Been through some ups and downs,
And whole lot of turn arounds.
I been on the shelf and even killed myself...
1,000 times ago and maybe 1,000
Times more., She said she comes from ice land...
I told her I was from the west.
She took me to the snow capped mountains...
And then she put me through the test...
We walked across the glacier,
The horses stayed behind...
And as we laid between the
Frozen vallies we kissed
For the very first time.
And now we're stuck together., It was too long ago.
But it seems like...years ago...
Since I felt the warm hello of the sun.
Lately things seem a little colder...
The wind, it seems to get a little bolder., Forget of my name
Remember it only as a hand shake,
Introduction to my belief which is god.
Ride instead the waves of my interpreture,
Music, sound
Hynotic if you choose
But truth and life
Regardless of your questionable timid compromises
Which I intend to erase.
Which I will erase without hint of reward
As I am only a messenger
And you a sheep in process of evolution
Almost at death with yourself
And on the staircase of birth.
Soon you may almost forget the smell of your family..."

So easy to explain
After they crucified him,
A woman, she claimed his name
The story of jesus
The whole Bible knows
Went all across the desert
And in the middle, he found a rose, There should be no questions
There should be no lies
He was married ever happily after
All the tears we cry
No use in arguing
All the use to the man that moans
When each man falls in battle
His soul it has to roam
Angles of heaven
Flying saucers to some,
Made easter sunday
The name of the rising sun, The story is written
By so many people who dared,
To lay down the truth
To so very many who cared
To carry the cross
Of jesus and beyond
We will guide the light
This time with a woman in our arms
We as men
Can't explain the reason why
The woman's always mentioned
At the moment that we die
All we know
Is God is by our side,
And he says the word
So easy yet so hard, I wish not to be alone,
So I must respect my other heart
Oh, the story
Of jesus is the story
Of you and me
No use in feeling lonely,
I am searching to be free, The story
Of life is quicker
Than the wink of an eye
The story of love
Is hello and goodbye
Until we meet again"

The tiny island sags downstream
'Cos the life that they lived is dead., And the wind screams Mary., Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past,
And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, ""No, this will be the last."", And The Wind Cries Mary."

Outshined the mud and history.
We washed and drank in
God's tears of joy,
And for once...and for everyone...
The truth was not a mystery--, Love called to all...music is magic.
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay.
Hand in hand as we lived and
Made real the dreams of peaceful men--, We came together...danced with
The pearls of rainy weather
Riding the waves of music and
Space--music is magic...
Magic is life...
Love as never loved before...
Harmony to son and daughter...man and wife."

This is the saddest story we all know why
So cry cry cry, Are you ready? Ready to leave

You know what I mean
No more whiskey, no more cigarettes, And your last breath just like a sunset
You know I love your old bones
I love your story but youre going home
Are you ready?, Are you ready? Ready to die
Are you ready? Ready to die
Is there anything I can do
'Cause saying goodbye to you, Will be the hardest thing I ever do
Dont worry buddy well see this thing through
Ill cry the river that carries you through
Are you ready?"
"At The Chime of a City Clock Lyrics","1971","Nick-Drake","At-The-Chime-of-a-City-Clock-Lyrics","A city freeze
Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought
You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet
Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again., And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armour down., Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbours only.
The games you play
Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far
On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place., And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place
Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for., The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose
If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale
Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range., In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride., But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armour down."

Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too long., Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I ain't got no food
Take me a shower
But the water don't feel no good., Tell me Tell Me, I've got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams.
Got the devil in my shoes, Tell me Tell me, Well when I'm smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Don't think about nothin'
Try not to see myself., Tell me Tell me, Well in this blues I'm singin'

Unless you want to get burned., Tell me Tell me..."

A party for the rent
You were sitting casually
With a few of your fabulous friends
I asked you what your name was
But you just turned and laughed
Then a little later
I finally caught your eye
And even though you tried so hard
You couldn't hide your smile
I followed you downstairs
And we talked for a long long time, Would you call that love
Who's to say
I don't know much about love
But you're the best I ever had, It wasn't long before you changed
Your phone number to mine
You said that you were movin' in
But you needed a little time
So I kept all your messages
Til you made up your mind
Now the rain is fallin' and the clouds are gathering
And the sun refuse to shine
Your promises and whispered words
Are forever on my mind
And I'm left here smokin' cigarettes
That you left behind, Would you call that love
Who's to say
I don't know much about love
But you're the best I ever had"

And ought to stay up in the sky
From the air she could wonder
For the reason

Or a season, Your life flies away
As the night turns to day
If you start once to think
Your hair will soon turn grey
But one would like to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season, The list of fallen stars
And crumbled, broken hearts
Comes from a need
To play so many parts
But one would like to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season, The wind and the rain
Shook hands again
Untouched by the world
They managed to keep sane
They were able to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season, Bird flew by
And wondered, wondered why
She was white
And ought to stay up in the sky
From the air she could wonder

The blossoms came and they brought you
Clouds left the sky
And I knew the reason why
They made way for you and the blossom., The seasons cycle turned again
An april shower now and then
Trees came alive
And the bees left their hive
They came out to see you and the blossom., People were laughing, smiling with the sun
They knew that summer had begun., The nights grew warm, the days grew long
Spring turned to summer and was gone
It seemed so fine
All the cider and the wine
But I knew you'd go with the blossom., When spring returns I'll look again
To find another blossom friend
Until I do
Find something new
I'll just think of you and the blossom."

What's been wrong with you
Won't you turn again
Blow away the rain
Blue season, turn away., Wind in the evening, dust in your eye
Heart full of shadow and cloud in your sky
Everything's wrong and you know you're to blame
Nothing will change while you're still the same
Cold in the city, tears on the street
Faces are empty in those that you meet
Lovers and losers who fail in the night
When will it be that you'll treat them right., Season tell me true
How much do we need you
Won't you turn your wheel
Hide your heart of steel
Blue season, turn away., Countries and people caught in the rain
When will they learn to feel fine again
Wandering lost now for nothing is clear
Waiting for signs of the turn of the year., Season tell me true
What's been wrong with you
Won't you turn again
Blow away in the rain
Blue season, turn away."

Always the last ones leaving
Waking up when fortunes knock, I've no regrets no I couldn't think of one

The road that we stumbled on
You and me walking home
Fighting the morning light
Just making our way through days
But making out like thieves at night, I can't help wondering
Can't help wondering why
I can't help wondering
Can't help wondering why, Sometimes you wake up screaming
All my life I must be dreaming
I've been wrong
And I'm not strong
But I'll be the one that keeps rolling on, Born to this generation
Never made to wait
Looking like fools sometimes
A couple of blind men at the gate, I can't help wondering
Can't help wondering why
I can't help wondering

She said she couldn't come to the garden
See a blind man kneel
She sailed away to a blue horizon
In floating thoughts she'd sway
She said she couldn't come to the garden

Maybe she'd join them soon
But she lost her grin at the tip of life's fingers
Went home and worshiped the moon"

Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving
Just a little too fast.
Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move., Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.
So try to be true,
Even if it's only in your hazey way., Can you tell if you're moving
With no mirror to see,
If you're just riding a new man
Looks a little like me.
Is it all so confusing,
Is it hard to believe
When the winter is coming
Can you sign up and leave.
Hey slow Jane, live your lie
Slow, slow jane, fly on by."
"Hazey Jane Ii Lyrics","2004","Nick-Drake","Hazey-Jane-Ii-Lyrics","And what will happen in the morning when the
world it gets so crowded that you can't look out
the window in the morning, And what will happen in the evening in the forest
with the weasel with the teeth that bite so sharp
when you're not looking in the evening, And all the friends that you once knew are left
behind they kept you safe and so secure amongst
the books and all the records of your lifetime, What will happen
In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't
look out the window in the morning, Hey, take a little while to grow your brothers hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eyeshade
Start over again, Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round, Let's sing a song
For Hazey Jane
She's back again in my mind
If songs were lines
In a conversation
The situation would be fine"
"I Was Made to Love Magic Lyrics","2006","Nick-Drake","I-Was-Made-to-Love-Magic-Lyrics","I was born to love no one
No one to love me
Only the wind in the long green grass
The frost in a broken tree., I was made to love magic
All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic
Many many years ago., I was born to use my eyes
Dream with the sun and the skies
To float away in a lifelong song
In the mist where melody flies., I was made to love magic..., I was born to sail away
Into a land of forever
Not to be tied to an old stone grave
In your land of never., I was made to love magic..."

Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night, If you leave me, pretty mama
Better take your picture too
Don't want to remember
What a good looking girl can do, Don't send me no letter
Don't write me no postcard
Thinking about you, baby
Makes it twice as hard, If you leave me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night, Well i`m sitting here
On the sudden
Watching the trees go by
My baby aint at the depot,
Gonna lay me down and cry, If you leave me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you

"Joey in Mind Lyrics","2006","Nick-Drake","Joey-in-Mind-Lyrics","When joey first came the light seemed to rise
Thought it came in the night and left with her eyes
And I wish that her face would return once again
Just one day to remind me of saturday's gain., As I sit in her city in fog and in steam
Everything's blurred, for blurred is my dream
So I'll leave for my terrace and tea laced with rum
And wait for the day when joey will come., And come all the dreams that never did try
To live on a memory or float on a sigh
Together we'll sit in the saturday rain
And dream of joey or mary jane."
"Leaving Me Behind Lyrics","2006","Nick-Drake","Leaving-Me-Behind-Lyrics","The tramp moves on to the end of the street
I listen to the echo of his hobnail feet
For some there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind., The world humes on at it's breakneck pace
People fly in their lifelong race
For them there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind., The chances they come, but the chances have been lost
Success can be gained, but at too great a cost
For some there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind., The wind sweeps up and goes back to it's tree
The rain flows by and moves to the sea
For them there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind."
"Mayfair Lyrics","2006","Nick-Drake","Mayfair-Lyrics","Mayfair strange in the morning light,
Mayfair strange in the summer night,
Mayfair strangest in the afternoon.
Mayfair stretching far above,
full of fame but lacking love,
Could it be we see the Mayfair moon?, Mayfair strange across the park,
In the day or in the dark,
There's no need to walk or even run.
Mayfair faces clean and nice,
But beauty here is cold as ice,
Could it be we see the Mayfair sun?, Mayfair strange at every hour,
Hidden frowns with mystic power,
Starry heights and golden throne,
Down below you're on you're own., Mayfair strange for passers-by,
Sights of wonder for the eye,
Could it be they'll pass by again?
Mayfair calling far and near,
For even trees are wealthy here,
Could it be we hear the Mayfair rain?
Mayfair strange in the morning light,
Mayfair strange in the summer night,
Mayfair strangest in the afternoon.
Mayfair stretching far above,
full of fame but lacking love,
Could it be we see the Mayfair moon?"
"Mickey's Tune Lyrics","2006","Nick-Drake","Mickeys-Tune-Lyrics","Sailing in seas of forget-me-not
Joining the race for the sun
Following baits made of daisy-chains
The new life has now begun., So go your way and I'll follow
Just lead the way., Drifting in lights of the fairground
Floating away on the breeze
Dazzled by scenes of a merry go round
You take the air with such ease., So go your way and I'll follow
Just lead the way., Dancing to midsummer nightsongs
Sprayed by the warmth of the rain
Blurred in the heat of a landscape
Fly to the moon once again., So go your way and I'll follow on the breeze
Float with such ease
Lead the way."

I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
But now you're here
Brighten my northern sky, I've been a long time that I'm waiting
Been a long time that I'm blown
I've been a long time that I've wandered
Through the people I have known
Oh, if you would and you could
Straighten my new mind's eye, Would you love me for my money
Would you love me for my head
Would you love me through the winter
Would you love me 'til I'm dead
Oh, if you would and you could
Come blow your horn on high, I never felt magic crazy as this
I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
But now you're here, Brighten my northern sky"

One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first., I could have been your pillar, could have been your door

Could have been your statue, could have been your friend,
A whole long lifetime could have been the end.
I could be yours so true

"Outside Lyrics","2006","Nick-Drake","Outside-Lyrics","Seems the time is near for finding a place outside
Seems the time is here for holding the window wide
So I'm going to try
To open up one eye
But if the world is too wide
I'll be home to hide
Keep it warm inside, if it's strange, outside., Seems the time has flown, when we lived inside a cloud
Seems the time has gone, when nothing we said was out loud
Going to find a word
Make myself be heard
But if the world is too loud
I'll be home from the crowd
Keep it soft inside, if it's strange, outside., Seems the time has come for banging our feet to the ground
Seems the time has come to see if the world is round
Sweep the smoke away
Reach the earth today
But if the world is all wrong
I won't be staying long
Keep it cool inside, if it's strange, outside."
"Phaedra's Meadow Lyrics","2007","Nick-Drake","Phaedras-Meadow-Lyrics","I was walking thru the forest
One cold and dreary morn
My heart sick with jealousy
And memories I need no more
No I could never kill a man
But I would do him harm
Knowing that you're there
Lying in his arms
My flesh was ripped and torn
By the bramble and the thorn
I was lost but well-prepared
To offer up my soul
Because the greater misery
Is to live with what I know
The moon concealed by April's storm
No bearing I could find
Until I fell into a clearing
And a road I recognized
I was far
Far from my home
Further from her smile
Not sure if I would return
Or just lay down and die
As I stood in Phaedra's Meadow
Well the dawn did break the sky
And from the highest up in heaven
The Weaving Star fell into my eyes"
"Poor Boy Lyrics","1971","Nick-Drake","Poor-Boy-Lyrics","Never sing for my supper
I never help my neighbour
Never do what is proper
For my share of labour., I'm a poor boy
And I'm a rover
Count your coins and
Throw them over my shoulder
I may grow older
Nobody knows
How cold it grows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If I cross their stiles., Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight., Never know what I came for
Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten., I'm a poor boy
And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads., Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife., He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white., Nobody knows
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If you cross their stiles., Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight., Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife., Oh poor boy

After a lifetime of dreaming
Poor mum

Whatever became of your scheming
Nothing worked out in the way that you planned
Nothing was quite as you thought
Try very hard not to misunderstand
Joy as it flies cannot be caught

Where did you take a wrong turning
Poor mum

Pack up that last little yearning
Pack it away with the books and the toys
Silent and bound
Silent and mend
Go out and grab at you life and forget
You are poor, poor mum"
"Rain Lyrics","2007","Nick-Drake","Rain-Lyrics","Thoughts of rain at sunset
Clouds of rainbow blue
Thoughts of sun on sand-dunes
Where the seabirds flew, This was our season and we said, it couldn't end
But my love left with the rain, Thoughts of leaves in autumn
Falling from the trees
Thoughts of hovering tree tops
Leading to the sea, This was our season, no lies and no pretend
But my love left with the rain, Thoughts of springtime rainfall
Touching flowers that bend
Thoughts of wind in willows
Days that never end, This was our season and we said it couldn't end
But my love left with the rain, Rain's the way you move now
Sun the way you seem
Flowers the, leaves the way you wonder
Flowers the way you dream, This was our season but sorrow waited 'round the bend
For my love left with the rain, This was our season and we said it couldn't end
But my love left with the rain"
"Rena Lyrics","2007","Nick-Drake","Rena-Lyrics","I got my plans
From trembling hands
I knew just what to do
Follow each step carefully
And hope they pulled me through
My father ran
To different lands
And not a word we spoke
But I was here
To conquer fear
And bring some glory home, There's a world of hate and sorrow
Out there standing in your way
There's a load of compromise
Before you die
And each time you step forward you get burned a little bit
No longer know the way
To say goodbye
Now I'm down here underneath
Your bedroom light
Rena please come out
With me tonight, I look in through
The window
And I though I'd take
My chance
I taught myself to play
So I could be where people danced
No higher call
Than stars that fall
I waited patiently
A thousand miles of pavement
That became my destiny, You can wait a lonely lifetime
Wondering when it's gonna come
You can while away the hours
Getting stoned
But one day you get lucky
And you look in someone's eyes
That tell you you don't
Have to be alone
Now I'm falling back
Just out of your sight
Rena please come out
With me tonight, Oh now I know the way things go
And what I put you through
Cause when they try to get to me
They get to me through you, I know it's not the kind of hurt
That's easily set right
And I know you got your reasons
To stay inside
But nothing ever happens
When it's left out on it's own
You locked in there with
Just your wounded pride
I'm down here and I'm
Way too tired to fight
Rena please come out
With me tonight
Rena please come out
With me tonight"

Said she had a word to say
About things today
And fallen leaves., Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes., Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time., If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime., Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure., For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more., Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free., If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me., Oh, how they come and go
Oh, how they come and go."
"Runaway Train Lyrics","2007","Nick-Drake","Runaway-Train-Lyrics","As he sat down upon the train
Silence settled in his brain
He reached out his hand
And touched her hair
He struggled with the
Same old though
Should he tell her
Should he not
He felt her presence
Everywhere, Whatever comes between us
Don't let it stand in your way
This is what he'd come
Here to say, She just smiled
And read a book
Gave him such a
Gentle look
He felt a pain right
Through his chest
He pictured back to
When they met
Open door on a movie set
Her brown eyes took
His breath, And every word she
Spoke to him
Went like a bullet to his
Heart
That's what he remembers
From the start, Now they're off
Searching in vain
Out of control
Just like a runaway train
Can't see that it's
Not up to them
Soon just like a river
They'll be rack home again, He sat up through
The hours it takes
Passing through the
Northern lakes
Til the sleeping giant was in his sight
He knew that she'd been drifting some
Wondered where his
Faith had gone
He stayed awake most
Of the night
Whatever makes you happy
I won't stand in your way
Words you hope you never
Have to say, Now they're off
Searching in vain
Out of control
Just like a runaway train
Can't see that it's
Not up to them
Soon just like a river
They'll be rack home again, She watched him toss
And try to sleep
Struggle with his
Demons deep
She thought of all
That they'd been through
Imagining her life alone
No where he was
That was home
She wondered if he knew, That every word
He spoke to her
Went like a bullet
To her heart
That's the way it's
Been right from
The start, Now they're off
Searching in vain
Out of control
Just like a runaway train
Can't see that it's
Not up to them
Soon just like a river
They'll be rack home again"
"Strange Meeting Ii Lyrics","2007","Nick-Drake","Strange-Meeting-Ii-Lyrics","Deep down in the depths of forgotten dreams
So far away so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand., As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand sighs
I called her my princess of the sand., She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess in the sand., One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone. of her presence there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand., Sometime when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, and i'll hope to find
That strange young dream, close behind
I'll call her my princess of the sand."

And I don't want to complicate it
But I hate this place
And there's only so much that I can take

Yes I know that I'm stuck on you"

Fell under your spell
Some fell into heaven
But most fell back in to hell

Like the snow-covered crops in the field
Where the wind knows no mercy
And she howls and she reels, But I'm tired of pretending

That I still care

To some forgotten land
Floating abandoned the mystery concealed
Like the moonlit shadows

In the heat of an evening
When only prisoners sleep
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See an old man wheel, She said her dreams
What too far to be thought of
As scars too white to view
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See a blind man kneel, She sailed away
To a blue horizon
In floating thoughts she'd sway
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See an old man pray, She wished them luck
As they left on their journey
Maybe she'd join them soon
But she lost her grip
At the tip of life's finger
Went home and worshipped the moon"

You never noticed lost in your crowd
Just no room for me up on that cloud, Can't find no changes
For better in my luck
Empty are my eyes and my heart
Cold grey days
The nights are so long
My heart is sinking
Bound to a stone, This old world is a bag of tricks
A whole lot of nothin'
Where nothin' ever fits
In all her glory she just don't compare
To one single tear
In your beautiful eyes, Thank you December
For your cold grey air
Lakes are frozen, trees are bare
I once loved her
Of that I am proud
Just no room for me

And a voice calling me.

Tell me with love
Where can it end it end
Voice from above., The sound on the ocean wave
And the sound in the tree
Sound in a country lane
Say you can be free.
Tell me you crowd you crowd
Tell me again
Tell me out loud out loud
This sound is rain., Tune from the hillside
And tune full of light
A flute in the morning
And a chime in the night.
I know the game again
I know the score
I know my name my name
But this tune is more., Voice from the mountain
And voice from the sea
Voice from in my neighbourhood
And a voice calling me.

Dance beneath the sky

What once was innocence, turned on its side
Grey cloud hangs over me - marks every move
Deep in the memory, what once was love, Oh how I realised how I wanted time
Put into perspective - tried so hard to find
Just for one moment I thought I'd found my way
Destiny unfolded - I watched it slip away, Excessive flashpoints - beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out - see what we can find
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires, I never realised the lengths I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know
Just for one moment I heard somebody call
Looked beyond the day in hand - there's nothing there at all, Now that I've realised how it's all gone wrong
Got to find some therapy - this treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Got to find my destiny before it gets too late"

Why must we be put down when we try to get away?
Why must we all grow up when we could just play and play?
Good things in life are free,
can't buy everything - that's true.
Only one thing wrong with that;
what I don't buy I don't use., Only thing I'm thinking of is why are we all here?
There must be more to do at nights than drinking rotten beer.
The world's a very shady place, and you can't trust a soul.
""grin and bear it"" seemed the thing,
when it just gets a hold., At a later date, I come out a fright.
At a later date, I hope that you're alright., Human beings are dangerous and they call me in the dark.
But everything gets twice as cold in marching for a lark.
There's loads of things I'd like to do, if I could find a time.
Working really tires me and I think I'll turn to crime., At a later date, I come out a soon.
At a later date, before we hit the moon., I just can't be bothered to make an effort here at all.
People make your paying contributions all too small.
I just can't be bothered to make an effort here at all.

My illusion
Worn like a mask of self-hate
Confronts and then dies.

Naked to see
Walking on air.
Hunting by the rivers
Through the streets
Every corner abandoned too soon
Set down with due care.

We saw ourselves now as we never had seen
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration
The sorrows we suffered and never were free, Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?, Weary inside, now, our heart's lost forever
Can't replace the fear for the thrill of the chase
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings
Open, then shut, then slammed in our face, Where have they been?
Where have they been?

To the centre of all life's desires
As a whole not an also ran
Love in a hollow field
Break the image of your father's son
Drawn to an inner feel
He was thought of as the only one
He was thought of as the only one, He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no, no, he can't pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man
Wise words and sympathy
Tell the story of our history
New strength gives a real touch
Sense and reason make it all too much
With a strange fatality
Broke the spirits of a lesser man
Some other race can see
In his way he was the only one
In his way he was the only one, He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no, no, he can't pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man
Now that it's time to decide
In his time he was a total man
Taken from Caesar's side
Kept in silence just to prove who's wrong
He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no, no, he can't pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man
All the failures of the Modern Man"

Young hearts fail, Anytime whereabouts
On the run, underground
Put your hand where it's safe
Lay your hand where it's safe

Do it again and again and again

Don't talk to me girl, you know it's not nice.
Don't laugh at murder, I won't pay the price.
The facts are too high-powered, so sickened thrill,
I'd give that mess up 'cos it makes you so ill., Blame bad things on me, whatever you do.
When I come home I will be different from you.
You're such a chictalk, you're really trussed up.
Don't wanna talk to you, just left me your mum., Don't be a puppet, always rush you around.
One just for you photo, try and tire me down.
I won't tell him I talk like this all night,
he must be worried 'cos you're sounding so trite., Respect is only normal, the way to our lives.
Ever tried to sleep around with a bed for a wife.
We'll never change you, if you start acting that way.
If do keep mouths all open, I'll never get a say.
You know what's special, it's as dark as I say.
Can you see me, just ourselves,
no comment, copycat!"

Away too long

Yeah, you there beside
The gaps only moment
We stared from each side, We were strangers
Away too long, Violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair
Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair
Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon, Me in my own world away too long
We were strangers, we were strangers
Away too long, away too long"

The waste in the fever I heat,

Cord stretches tight then it breaks,
Someday we will die in your dreams,
How I wish we were here with you now."

They don't rise up, just descend
But I don't care anymore
I've lost the will to want more, I'm not afraid, not at all
I watch them all as they fall

When we were young, Those with habits of waste
Their sense of style and good taste
Of making sure you were right
Hey, don't you know you were right, I'm not afraid anymore
I keep my eyes on the door
But I remember, Tears of sadness for you
More upheaval for you
Reflects a moment in time
A special moment in time, Yeah, we wasted our time
We didn't really have time
But we remember
When we were young, And all God's angels beware
And all you judges beware

"Interzone Lyrics","1999","Joy-Division","Interzone-Lyrics","I walked through the city limits
Someone talked me in to try to do it
Attracted by some force within it
Had to close my eyes to get close to it, Around a corner where a prophet lay
Saw the place where she had a room to stay
A wire fence where the children play
Saw the bed where the body lay, And I was looking for a friend of mine
And I had no time to waste
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine, The cars screeched, hear the sound on dust
Heard a noise, just a car outside
Metallic blue turned red with rust
Pulled in close by the building's side, In a group, all forgotten youth
Had to think, collect my senses now
Are turned on to a knife edged view
Find some places where my friends don't know, And I was looking for a friend of mine
And I had no time to waste
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine, Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same
Getting darker now, faces look the same
And I walked round and round, nail me to a train
No stomach, torn apart, had to think again
Trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out
Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out, Four, twelve windows, ten in a row
Behind a wall, well I looked down low
The lights shined like a neon show
Inserted deep, felt a warmer glow, No place to stop, no place to go
No time to lose, had to keep on going
I guess they died some time ago
I guess they died some time ago, And I was looking for a friend of mine
And I had no time to waste
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine"

He calls her aloud from above
Carefully watched for a reason
Painstaking devotion and love, Surrendered to self preservation
From others who care for themselves
A blindness that touches perfection
But hurts just like anything else, Isolation, isolation, isolation, Mother, I tried please believe me
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through
I'm ashamed of the person I am, Isolation, isolation, isolation, But if you could just see the beauty
These things I could never describe
These pleasures a wayward distraction,
This is my one lucky prize
Isolation, isolation, isolation
Isolation"
"Komakino Lyrics","2006","Joy-Division","Komakino-Lyrics","This is the hour when the mysteries emerge
A strangeness so hard to reflect
A moment so moving goes straight to your heart
The vision that's never been met
The attraction is held like a weight deep inside
Something I'll never forget, The pattern is set - the reaction will start
Complete but rejected too soon
Looking ahead in the grip of each tear
Recalls the life that we knew
The shadow that stood by the side of the road
Always reminds me of you, How can I find the right way to control
All the conflicts inside, all the problems beside
As the questions arise, and the answers don't fit
Into my way of things, into my way of things"
"Leaders of Men Lyrics","2006","Joy-Division","Leaders-of-Men-Lyrics","Born from some mother's womb
Just like any other room
Made a promise for a new life
Made a victim out of your life, When your time's on the door
And it drips to the floor
And you feel you can touch
All the noise is too much
And the seeds that are sown
Are no longer your own, Just a minor operation
To force a final ultimatum
Thousand words are spoken loud
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd, When you walk down the street
And the sound's not so sweet
And you wish you could hide
Maybe go for a ride
To some peep show arcade
Where the future's not made, A nightmare situation
Infiltrate imagination
Smacks of past Holy wars
By the wall with broken laws, The leaders of men
Born out of your frustration
The leaders of men
Just a strange infatuation
The leaders of men
Made a promise for a new life
No saviour for our sakes
To twist the internees of hate
Self induced manipulation
To crush all thoughts of mass salvation"

A change of scene, with no regrets
A chance to watch, admire the distance
Still occupied, though you forget, Different colours, different shades
Over each mistakes were made
I took the blame
Directionless so plain to see
A loaded gun won't set you free
So you say, We'll share a drink and step outside
An angry voice and one who cried
""We'll give you everything and more
The strain's too much, can't take much more""
Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire
Can't seem to feel it anymore, It was me, waiting for me
Hoping for something more
Me, seeing me this time
Hoping for something else"

Didn't hear the warning
Waiting for the tape to run
We've been moving around in different situations
Knowing that the time would come
Just to see you torn apart
Witness to your empty heart
I need it
I need it
I need it, Through the wire screen, the eyes of those standing outside looked in
At her as into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo
In the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument
Which they had that morning inserted deep into her body. 
She shuddered instinctively. 
No life at all in the house of dolls
No love lost. 
No love lost, You've been seeing things
In darkness, not in learning
Hoping that the truth will pass
No life underground, wasting never changing
Wishing that this day won't last
To never see you show your age
To watch until the beauty fades
I need it
I need it
I need it, Two-way mirror in the hall
They like to watch everything you do
Transmitters hidden in the walls
So they know everything you say is true
Turn it on
Don't turn it on
Turn it on"

"Passover Lyrics","2006","Joy-Division","Passover-Lyrics","This is a crisis, I knew had to come
Destroying the balance I'd kept
Doubting, unsettling and turning around
Wondering what will come next, Is this the role that you wanted to live?
I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard
It all falls apart at first touch, Watching the reel as it comes to a close
Brutally taking it's time
People who change for no reason at all
Happening all of the time, Can I go on with this train of events?
Disturbing and purging my mind
Back out of my duties when all's said and done
I know that I'll lose every time, Moving along in our God given ways
Safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles
Left with a mark on the door, Is this the gift that I wanted to give?
Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more
And watch as they drop by the beach, This is the crisis I knew had to come
Destroying the balance I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lives
Wondering what will come next"

In a room with no window in the corner I found truth, In the shadowplay, acting out your own death, knowing no more
As the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor
Yeah, with cold steel, odour on their bodies made a move to connect
I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left, I did everything, everything I wanted to
I let them use you for their own ends
To the centre of the city at night, waiting for you
To the centre of the city at night, waiting for you"

She's lost control
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by

And she gave away the secrets of her past

And a voice that told her when and where to act
She said, ""I've lost control again""
And she turned around and me and took me by the hand
And said, ""I've lost control again""
How I'll never know just why or understand
She said, ""I've lost control again""
And she screamed out kicking on her side
And said, ""I've lost control again""
And seized up on the floor I thought she'd die
She said, ""I've lost control ""
She's lost control again
She's lost control
She's lost control again
She's lost control
And I had to phone her friend to state my case
And say, ""She's lost control again""
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes
And said, ""I've lost control again""
And she expressed herself in many different ways
Until she lost control again
And walked upon the edge of no escape
And laughed, ""I've lost control""
She's lost control again
She's lost control
She's lost control again
She's lost control, I could live a little better with the myths and the lies
When the darkness broke in, I just broke down and cried
I could live a little in a wider line
When the change is gone, when the urge is gone
To lose control, When here we come"

Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain, Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside, Cry like a child, though these years make me older
With children my time is so wastefully spent
A burden to keep, though their inner communion
Accept like a curse an unlucky deal, Played by the gate at the foot of the garden

No words could explain, no actions determine
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall"

"Transmission Lyrics","1999","Joy-Division","Transmission-Lyrics","Radio, live transmission.
Radio, live transmission., Listen to the silence, let it ring on.
Eyes, dark grey lenses frightened of the sun.
We would have a fine time living in the night,
Left to blind destruction,
Waiting for our sight., And we would go on as though nothing was wrong.
And hide from these days we remained all alone.
Staying in the same place, just staying out the time.
Touching from a distance,
Further all the time., Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio..., Well I could call out when the going gets tough.
The things that we've learnt are no longer enough.
No language, just sound, that's all we need know,
To synchronise love to the beat of the show., And we could dance., Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio..."
"Twenty Four Hours Lyrics","1999","Joy-Division","Twenty-Four-Hours-Lyrics","So this is permanence, love's shattered pride
What once was innocence, turned on its side
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move
Deep in the memory, of what once was love
Oh how I realised how I wanted time
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find
Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way
Destiny unfolded, I watched it slip away
Excessive flash points, beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires
I never realised the lengths I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know
Just for one moment, I heard somebody call
Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all
Now that I've realised how it's all gone wrong
Gotta find some therapy, this treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too late."

when first light came around.
I grew up like a changeling
to win the first time around.
I can see all the weakness
I can pick all the faults
Well, I concede all the faith tests
just to stick in your throats
3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 g, I hung around in your soundtrack
to mirror all that you've done
to find the right side of reason
to kill the three lies for one
I can see all the cold facts
I can see through your eyes
All this talk made no contact
no matter how hard we tried
3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 g, I can still hear the footsteps
I can only see walls
I slid into your man-traps
with no hearing at all
I just see contradiction
had to give up the fight
just to live in the past tense
to make believe you were right

The power and glory of sin, what did you see there?
The blood of Christ on their skins
I traveled far and wide through many different times, I traveled far and wide where unknown martyrs died, what did you see there?
I saw the one-sided trials, what did you see there?
I saw the tears as they cried
They had tears in their eyes, Tears in their eyes

She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make them their own
Where do bad folks go when they die?

They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July"

To write off lines that don't make sense, I love myself better than you

And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean no dirt to be seen
And the work it was fun, There's nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words, Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau

People that despise you will analyze then criticize you
they'll scandalize and tell lies until they realize
you are someone they should have apologized to
don't let these people compromise you
be wise too
You can do anything you want to do
it's not wrong what i sing it's true
you can do anything you want to do
do what you want to
Hey you you're not their puppet on a string
you can do everything
it's true if you really want to
you can do anything you want
Just like i do
You can do anything you want to do
it's not wrong when i sing it's true
you can do anything you want to do
do what you want
Hey you
no can do
hey you
yes you

the king of rock'n roll is dead
elvis is dead

"Get Out of Here Lyrics","1979","Thin-Lizzy","Get-Out-of-Here-Lyrics","Pack up, I've had enough, that's it, I quit
Give up, you win, I lose, you win
You choose, you stay
I'll go, you stay, I lose, I used to be a dreamer
But I realize that it's not my style at all
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer
Doesn't stand a chance at all, Get out of here
Get out of here
Get out
Do I make myself clear, No way, I must go, can't stay, must run
No chance, I can't give a second chance
No hope, there's no hope for you now
No romance, no more romance, No how, no how could we stay together
No need, I have no need for you now
No fear, no fear of you no more, Get out of here
Get out of here
Do I make myself clear
Pack up, give in, go home, get out, I used to be a dreamer
But I realized that it's not my style at all
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer
Doesn't stand a chance at all, And I've become bitter
For I believe that this is better
No matter, whatever, whenever
We can never ever stay together
Get out of here
Go, Do I make myself plain
I don't want to ever see you again
Get out of here, Pack up, give in, get out of here
Rev up, go away, get out of here
Give in, go home, right away, get to
Pack up, give in, give up, rev up
Go away ... out"

That stuff
I've got to give it up I've got to give it up
That stuff, Tell my mama and tell my pa
That their fine young son didn't get far
He made it to the end of a bottle
Sitting in a sleazy bar, He tried hard but his spirit broke
He tried until he nearly choked
In the end he lost his
Bottle drinking alcohol, I've got to give it up I've got to give it up
That stuff
I've got to give it up I've got to give it up
That stuff, Tell my brother I tried to write and
Put pen to paper but I was frightened
I couldn't seem to get the words out right
Right quite right, Tell my sister I'm sinking slow
Now and again I powder my nose
In the end I lost my bottle
It smashed in a casbah, I've got to give it up I've got to give it up
That stuff
I've got to give it up I've got to give it up
That stuff, I've got to give it up I've got to give it up
That stuff
I've got to give it up I've got to give it up
That stuff, I've been messing with the heavy stuff
For a time I couldn't get enough
But I'm waking up and it's wearing off
Junk don't take you far, Tell my Mama I'm coming home
In my youth I'm getting older
And I think it's lost control
Mama I'm coming home, I've got to give it up I've got to give it up

I've got to give it up I've got to give it up

We're going to go out on the town
We'll be checking it out, slipping it in
And stepping out of line

In their own particular way
But my buddies and I we go over the top
And we're going over again today, We'll be having a good time
Passing the by-line

Then it's improbable, that you do anything

We like to go over the hill

We'll be having a good time

And he likes err... it in the night

I must say, is Scott Gorham
And away..."", We'll be having a good time

Having a wild time
Having a good time
I'm slipping on the inside
Having a good time
That's fine having a good time
Having a good time
Drinking Beaujolais
No that doesn't rhyme
Having a good time
I'm talking from the top of my head
Having a good time
To the bottom of your soul"

Into the arms of a sugar daddy
She'd been having a good time
Oh but she loved her daddy madly, She said daddy what can I do
I want to spend my time making love to you
But daddy had to run hit and run
Now he's gone, S&M, This customer was shady he kept a rubber hose
He liked to beat the ladies
There's nothing wrong with that I suppose
""Yes there is,"", He made them want to shout, ""Ouch""
But this time you better watch out
He kicked her oh and he beat her
And he whipped her, S&M, He beat her black and blue, He just liked the violence said it made him tough
He just liked the violence said she couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough
Smack, S&M, He beat her like a drum, This fetish could be foolish
It could lead to something dangerously wreckless
To hold your lover helpless
Could lead to something called a mess, Unless you like to be tacky
And kinky, sleasy and slinky
To make them wanna shout, ""Ouch""
Fight back and scratch out, S&M, Do it again"

In the morning light
Down on the sidewalk there's a woman with a problem
But she don't know how to fight, She's destitute and broken down
She softly whispers is there no one around
And no one hears the sound
Her knees give way and hit the ground, This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest, Like a rat in a pack it attacks
From the back
Through a crack in a track
And you take a smack, This Jack has had a hard day
No one told him it would be like this
He's had to score the hard way
Working on twenty hour shifts, This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest
It's tough stuff
This is the toughest street around
This is the toughest
Don't you do down
No how, It's just another black spot
Where far too many people have died
It's just another grave yard
And there's not too many people left alive, This is the toughest
Are you tough enough
This is the toughest
Are you rough enough
This is the toughest
Can you bluff enough, Just a minor misery did me no harm
But it's there to warn, outside the window
The neon is still flashing in the morning light
Down on the sidewalk that woman was blown away
Out of sight, All across the city no one gives a damn
All across the city no one seems to understand
This is the toughest
This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest street around
This is the toughest
Are you rough enough
This is the toughest
If I were you I wouldn't come around here
This is the toughest
This is the toughest
Are you tough enough"

Against the odds he smokes another cigarette
Says that it helps him to forget
That he's a nervous wreck, It's not that he misses much
Or even that he's lost his lucky touch
It's just that he gambles so much
